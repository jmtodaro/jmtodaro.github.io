	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently was invited to give a Tor talk at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncfta.net/default2.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.  Who is NCFTA?  They are a non-profit that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;brings together local, state, and federal law enforcement, businesses, and academic institutions to functionally collaborate on cybercrime issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tor talk was given to around 30 people who either investigate or use Tor daily as part of their role at NCFTA.  The talk lasted around 2 hours with many questions.  A handful of people hung out afterwards while I showed them the internals of Tor Browser Bundle (which circumvented their firewall just fine &lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost/jmtodaro/tor/blog/tags/presentations/../../smileys/smile4.png&quot; alt=&quot;;)&quot; /&gt; and the Incognito LiveCD.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a great visit to a bunch of smart people who need Tor to do their job safely.&lt;/p&gt;
