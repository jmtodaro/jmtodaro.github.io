	<description>&lt;p&gt;This summer I have been working on new feature for the Torbutton Firefox extension with Mike Perry as my mentor. The Tor Project volunteer page describes this project as requiring a high skill and effort level. Initially, I was confident in the effort that I was capable of putting forth, however I was doubtful of my skill level. My knowledge of XUL (an xml based markup language for the Mozilla Framework) and Javascript  was a medium at best.  Knowing that I was going to have to spend a good amount of time becoming adept with these languages, I took on writing three new features for Torbutton.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first feature is handling tor:// and tors:// urls. I implemented these protocols to be handled by Torbutton, and will be opened in your Tor connection.  If you do not have Tor enabled, you will be prompted to enable it. In addition, I added options in any linkâ€™s context menu for copying Tor URLs and opening them in a new window or tab. &lt;span class=&quot;read-more&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.torproject.org/blog/summer-torbutton&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;read&amp;nbsp;more&amp;nbsp;&amp;raquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
