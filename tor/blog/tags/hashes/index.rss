	<description>&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve published our &lt;a href=&quot;https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/doc/roadmaps/2008-12-19-roadmap-full.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;three-year development roadmap&lt;/a&gt;.  There are two main goals in publishing this document: first to be more transparent in what we&#39;re doing; and second to ask for help in improving everything related to Tor.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we don&#39;t expect everyone will read through the roadmap start to finish, the Table of Contents provides a quick overview of the high-level goals.  Each high-level goal is fairly independent of another, so you can simply read about the goals that interest you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for the first time ever, we&#39;ve created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.torproject.org/press/2008-12-19-roadmap-press-release.html.en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.  This is our attempt to become more press friendly and provide a way for the media to start a conversation with us.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcome your comments and feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
