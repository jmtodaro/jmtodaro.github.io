	<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, a number of exit relay operators have contacted us asking for help with some legal issues encountered while running their relay.  While we can&#39;t provide legal advice in all jurisdictions, we can frequently find you a next hop in the legal chain to get you the advice or representation you need.  Sometimes this advice is free/pro-bono, other times it is not.  It&#39;s up to the legal organization to decide if they can take your case or refer you to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than keep a secret list of people willing to help, we&#39;re building a public list for operators to contact directly, in their own country.  A big thanks to Fred and Gwen at the EFF for helping to start this list and for making introductions. And, of course, a big thanks to the organizations for agreeing to be listed and for offering support to Tor relay operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;d like to add your name to this list, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current list of legal support organizations by country is: &lt;span class=&quot;read-more&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.torproject.org/blog/start-tor-legal-support-directory&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;read&amp;nbsp;more&amp;nbsp;&amp;raquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In early January after 24C3, I travelled to Stuttgart to meet with the&lt;br /&gt;
police there. I spoke to about 30 or 40 investigators. My goal wasn&#39;t&lt;br /&gt;
to advocate for any particular laws or policies (that&#39;s up to them,&lt;br /&gt;
after all), but rather to help give them background so they can make&lt;br /&gt;
more informed decisions: explain who uses Tor and how it works, and try&lt;br /&gt;
to answer any questions that come up. In particular, my goals were to&lt;br /&gt;
open a discussion about the data retention laws, and also brainstorm&lt;br /&gt;
how German Tor operators and German law enforcement can get along better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the fellow who did the September 2006 seizures was&lt;br /&gt;
part of this group, and he was very interested to talk to me and learn&lt;br /&gt;
more about Tor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They explained that the data retention laws *they&#39;d* asked for were&lt;br /&gt;
basically that large ISPs should be required to answer them when they&lt;br /&gt;
ask who had a given IP address at a given time (data the ISPs already&lt;br /&gt;
keep for the most part), and as a bonus, it would be nice if they paid&lt;br /&gt;
somebody to answer the requests on weekends too. The law that they got&lt;br /&gt;
was way more than that, and they don&#39;t need or want most of it. &lt;span class=&quot;read-more&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.torproject.org/blog/talking-german-police-stuttgart&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;read&amp;nbsp;more&amp;nbsp;&amp;raquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
