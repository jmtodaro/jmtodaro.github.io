<p>We're glad that the Internet Service Providers in Egypt are announcing their routes to the world and have <a href="http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/02/egypt-returns-to-the-internet.shtml" rel="nofollow">rejoined the Internet</a>.  We are concerned because it is possible that traffic crossing the Egyptian border is being recorded and possibly saved for future use.  <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download#warning" rel="nofollow">Correctly using Tor</a> to and from Egyptian destinations will keep your traffic anonymous.</p>

<p>Tor separates who you are from where you are going on the Internet.  It's up to you, the user, to choose where you share your personal information. Currently, we do not try very hard to hide that you are using Tor.  In the past few years, we haven't needed to hide. Tor looks like an SSL connection on the wire. Your local ISP, if they are very clever, could map your current connections from your assigned IP address to the list of public Tor relays. This would only tell them you are using Tor, not where you are going on the Internet. We do offer <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en" rel="nofollow">bridge relays</a>, which are semi-public relays published in a few selective ways. By using bridges, your ISP is unlikely to figure out you are using Tor. We need thousands more bridges, please <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay" rel="nofollow">join the Tor network</a> to help others.</p>

<p>Many years ago, we theorized this arms race could happen.  Recent events have turned theory into reality. We are working on improvements to make it much more difficult to detect Tor usage. These methods include <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/spec/proposals/176-revising-handshake.txt" rel="nofollow">normalization of our TLS usage</a> and <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/spec/proposals/ideas/xxx-pluggable-transport.txt" rel="nofollow">tunneling</a> Tor through other protocols, such as XMPP, HTTPS, and HTTP.</p>

<p>Thanks to some <a href="https://secure.avaaz.org/en/egypt_blackout/" rel="nofollow">funding from Avaaz</a>, we've also begun experimenting with ways to make Tor perform better on satellite and mesh networks.  We have Tor working well on <a href="https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/" rel="nofollow">mobile phone 3G and 4G connections</a>. Tor over <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Very_small_aperture_terminal" rel="nofollow">VSAT</a> and <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Broadband_Global_Area_Network" rel="nofollow">BGAN</a> connections does work, however it needs more research into how to better handle the variable latencies and varying available bandwidth on such connections.  The improvements that result from this research will benefit those with little to no Internet access, whether due to political unrest, natural disasters, or remote locations, who nonetheless seek to keep their online activities safe.</p>

<div class="inlinecontent">
<p>We need a better understanding of how much anonymity the Tor network provides against a partial network adversary who observes and/or operates some of the network. Specifically, we want to understand the chances that this class of adversary can observe a user's traffic coming into the network and also the corresponding traffic exiting the network.</p>

<p>Most of our graphs historically have looked at the total number of relays over time. But this simple scalar doesn't take into account relay capacity, exit policies, geographic or network location, etc.</p>

<p>One concrete problem from this bad metric is that when many new relays show up (e.g. due to a <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/files/relays-diff-2011-01-28.png">political event</a>), we really don't have any insight about how the diversity of the new relays compares to the rest of the network. The simplistic metric also gets misused in academic research papers to produce misleading results like "I can sign up 2% of the Tor relays and capture 50% of the paths," when what they mean is "I can provide half the capacity in the Tor network and capture half the paths."</p>

<p>There are four parts to this research problem. First, we need a broad array of metrics that reflect various instances of our partial network adversary. Second, we need to understand for each metric how stable it is (sensitivity analysis) and what changes in the Tor network would efficiently improve (or harm) it. Third, we should make the calculations as realistic as possible based on actual Tor client behavior. Last, we need a better infrastructure for comparing the safety impact from alternate design scenarios, for example different path selection or route balancing algorithms.</p>

<p>We'd love to <a href="https://www.torproject.org/research">work with you</a> to help answer these questions. <span class="read-more"><a href="http://blog.torproject.org/blog/research-problem-measuring-safety-tor-network"><strong>read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</strong></a></span></p>

<li>Held a successful public hackfest at MIT's Center for Future Civic<br />
Media,<br />
<a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/boston-tor-hackers-join-us-saturday-january-" title="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/boston-tor-hackers-join-us-saturday-january-" rel="nofollow">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/boston-tor-hackers-join-us-saturday-jan...</a><br />
15th.</li>
<li>Due to the events in Egypt, Tor usage by activists, and human rights<br />
organizations requesting our technical help, we were featured in over 30 news<br />
stories, interviews, and articles. The master list of the media highlights is at<br />
<a href="https://www.torproject.org/press/inthemedia.html.en" title="https://www.torproject.org/press/inthemedia.html.en" rel="nofollow">https://www.torproject.org/press/inthemedia.html.en</a>.  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bridge relay and bridge authority work.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Karsten did some work to publish sanitized bridge pool assignments. We're<br />
going to publish the information which distribution pool a bridge is assigned<br />
to.  The distribution pool defines whether we're giving out bridges via HTTP,<br />
via email, or not at all (reserved pool).  The plan is to remove all sensitive<br />
information from bridge pool assignments before making them available on<br />
<a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/data.html" title="https://metrics.torproject.org/data.html" rel="nofollow">https://metrics.torproject.org/data.html</a>.  The discussion was started on<br />
the or-dev list<br />
at <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Jan-2011/msg00033.html" title="http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Jan-2011/msg00033.html" rel="nofollow">http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Jan-2011/msg00033.html</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scalability, load balancing, directory overhead, efficiency.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We released an updated version of Tor<br />
Weather, <a href="https://weather.torproject.org" title="https://weather.torproject.org" rel="nofollow">https://weather.torproject.org</a>.  Tor Weather is a web application used<br />
to allow tor relay operators to sign up for notices when their relay is offline,<br />
drops below a threshold of bandwidth served, and receive notifications when a<br />
new version of tor is released.  This version of the web application was written<br />
by the Wesleyan University Humantarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS)<br />
team working on Tor for their summer project, <a href="http://hfoss.wesleyan.edu/" title="http://hfoss.wesleyan.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://hfoss.wesleyan.edu/</a>. </li>
<li>Karsten started improving metrics-db performance, so that it can scale to<br />
five years of data with 10K relays and 5K bridges.  This included a few tricks<br />
to avoid parsing the same data twice.  Also changed the database schema to use<br />
SQL arrays to store bandwidth histories, which is apparently a less used part of<br />
PostgreSQL, because he found a confirmed bug in PostgreSQL 8.2 (released<br />
2006-12-05).</li>
<li>Karsten found two major, if not blocking, bugs in Torouter when run on the<br />
suggested Buffalo hardware. The Excito hardware does not have these problems.<br />
The bug numbers are 2334,<br />
<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2334" title="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2334" rel="nofollow">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2334</a>, and 2376,<br />
<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2376" title="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2376" rel="nofollow">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2376</a>.</li>
<li>Karsten found and fixed a problematic bridge sanitizer bug that made us<br />
keep original IP addresses in reject lines.  Updated metrics-db and sanitized<br />
all bridge descriptors since May 2008 once again.  The latter kept two of our<br />
computers busy for 2.5 weeks.</li>
<li>Karsten started with exporting bridge pool assignments and restarted<br />
discussion about preserving hashed IP addresses in bridge descriptors.</li>
<li>Karsten upgraded Torperfs to output information about which circuits they<br />
used for measuring download times.  Made data available on metrics website.<br />
Added new graphs combining all Torperf sources and showing the fraction of<br />
timeouts and failures.  Started Torperfs with custom entry guard selection<br />
strategies.</li>
<li>Karsten talked to Björn Scheuermann and Florian Tschorsch about<br />
performance improvements in Tor.  Working on a patch with them to be included in<br />
Tor 0.2.3.x.</li>
<li>Karsten improved graphs on metrics-web by adding more countries and by<br />
allowing users to customize the graph image resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>More reliable download mechanism.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Sebastian and Erinn started to tackle Thandy and Hudson work. They solved<br />
the Hudson issue on Windows and made a good deal of progress on getting Thandy<br />
set up, understanding the different roles and responsibilities of each in the<br />
Thandy system. Installing files by copying into the right place works, but the<br />
packaging db that would be required for TBB is not yet working.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Translations</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Updated translations for the following languages: af ak am arn ast be bg bn<br />

<div class="inlinecontent">
<p>I was asked to give a five minute speech to open a panel in front of a number of policy makers and advisors in Washington, DC in the past few weeks.  The discussion was under <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule" rel="nofollow">Chatham House Rule</a>.  A number of people have encouraged me to publish the speech notes as a blog post, it is as follows.</p>

<blockquote><p>Here I am, a technologist in a room full of policy people.  I'll stick<br />
to what I know and try not to put anyone to sleep in the next five<br />
minutes.</p>
<p>Technology is agnostic, who uses and how they use it matters.  Roads,<br />
cars, phones, email, websites are all technologies used for good and bad.<br />
In the 1930s, the feds and police warned of mass chaos if the interstate<br />
highway system was built in the US.  The ability for criminals to quickly<br />
transit between cities was of grave concern. Crime would spread faster,<br />
further, and this would hasten the breakdown of the very fabric of the<br />
American society, community. Time has shown the benefits vastly outweighed<br />
the costs.  This same principle has shown to be true of the internet<br />
and computer technology.  Sure, we may have new kinds of crime with botnets,<br />
zombies, phishing, but do we really?  Lying, impersonation, and tricking<br />
someone into doing your work are the same crimes they have been for the<br />
past few millenia.  It's just that the substrate that is used, has changed.<br />
What are some of the largest companies in the world?  GE, IBM, Apple,<br />
Microsoft, Google.  What one should or should not do is policy and law,<br />
what one can actually do or not do is technology.</p>
<p>Circumvention, anonymity, and privacy tools used in a free world can be<br />
a minor annoyance, i.e. wikileaks used wikis, ssl, email, and yes, tor,<br />
but in the end, it's an annoyance.  We don't have people in the streets<br />
rioting trying to overthrow our govt. Wikipedia uses the same technology<br />
in wikis, ssl, and email. Everyone loves Wikipedia and considers it a net positive.</p>
<p>The same circumvention, anonymity, and privacy tools are deadly to<br />
repressive regimes.  The free flow of information and education are of<br />
great concern to a regime trying to control the horizontal and vertical<br />
of every day life. The tactics a regime can use are legal, technical,<br />
and physical.  The regime can switch between tactics, generally<br />
depending upon what's economical and most effective.</p>
<p>Roughly 1 billion people are online in some way.  Berkman did a study<br />
that found roughly 2% of that billion know what a proxy is, or even that<br />
technology exists to circumvent internet censorship.  98% of the world<br />
accepts that facebook, google, cnn, and the bbc, are blocked and doesn't<br />
try to find ways around it. This doesn't even broach the topic of online<br />
privacy relating to commercial entities nor law enforcement and<br />
intelligence agencies trying to learn the who, what, where, and how of your Internet activities.</p>
<p>Arguing about which proxy technology should get all of the funding and<br />
attention is silly.  The budgets and adversaries vastly outweigh the<br />
funding and research into proxies.  It's not a zero-sum game, and<br />
the different technologies take very different approaches to success;<br />
freegate/ultrasurf, vpns, psiphon, and web proxies play a game of cat<br />
and mouse with ip addresses and sometimes encryption; tor uses the<br />
strategy of R&amp;D and protecting ones anonymity and privacy first, the<br />
secondary effects of this are well-suited to circumvention too.  Tor,<br />
freegate, psiphon, and vpns sum up to roughly $50m in funding from the US govt<br />
of the past few years.  Only a very small fraction of that total has made it to actual technology.  Compare that to the billions spent on snakeoil<br />
black box technology by the DoD and intelligence agencies preparing for<br />
a cyberwar arms race, much like the nuclear arms race, to deter other<br />
nations from attacking us.</p>
<p>I talked to a member of a terrorist organization in Vietnam.  He's been<br />
stalked, harassed, and had everything confiscated multiple times by his<br />
government.  You know his organization as Deutsche Welle.  He's a<br />
reporter.  He had no idea how his plans, documents, and contacts were<br />
being discovered and used against him. His ability to understand the<br />
differences between Tor, JAP, and Freegate was like asking which tires<br />
are best for gravel, snow, or tarmac.  The question he didn't even know<br />
to ask is, "What are safe and secure computing and online practices?"<br />
to use my analogy, "what car do I want for those tires?  the answer is<br />
a rally car."   I spent 4 hours going over how the internet works,<br />
how to think about adversaries online, what is ssl, what it means, what<br />
are phishing, viruses, botnets, and state-sponsored malware.  By the<br />
end of the 4th hour, he understood how tor is different than a simple<br />
vpn or proxy server, and when to use tor and when it isn't needed. 3.5h<br />
of that discussion was basic operational, computer, and online security<br />
and safe practices.</p>
<p>So where does this leave us?  It leaves us with a mix of education,<br />
technology, and many, many unanswered questions.  This is a young field<br />
overall.  As the censorship providers and technologies get better, so<br />
will those circumvention technologies.  Educating users about internet<br />
safety, risks, and making the tools vastly easier and safer to use<br />
should be a goal.</p>
<p>Tor published a "10 things to think about circumvention tools" paper to<br />
try to distill what we've learned over the past 10 years of doing this.<br />
In a few of these areas, tor is not the best choice, for now.</p>
<p>What about technology?  Isn't it going to save us all?  Currently,<br />
freegate/ultrasurf, vpns, and web proxies are looking for money to fund<br />
their growing infrastructure costs. The more users you have, the more<br />
servers, more bandwidth, and more costs you incur.  Its a quick way to<br />
spend lots of money and get lots of users.  However becoming the ISP for<br />
the world gets very expensive, very quickly as you scale up to hundreds<br />
of millions of users.  Look at the infrastructures of google, facebook,<br />
yahoo, and microsoft to see the challenges that lie ahead for these tools.</p>
<p>Tor and "distributed tools" look to improve the research and development<br />
and rely on the scaling of users to both provide the circumvention and<br />
grow to become a self-sustaining ISP to the world.  We have only begun<br />
to see the power and effects of these technologies with bittorrent, jap,<br />
skype, freenet, i2p, and tor.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thank you to all who showed up for <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-open-hackfest-february-19-2011" rel="nofollow">the hackfest</a> at MIT on Saturday the 19th.  Roughly 50 people attended the event at some point throughout the day.  People traveled from the local area, Maine, New York, Connecticut, and one person rearranged their flights from California to hack with us.  The free pizza, drinks, and donuts were provided to all thanks to some generous attendees.</p>

<p>And a final thank you to the <a href="http://civic.mit.edu/" rel="nofollow">Center for Future Civic Media</a> who once again offered the facilities and support for our hackfest.</p>

<p>Now that you've met us, are interested in helping the world, and want to learn more, here are some ideas on getting involved: <a href="http://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer" title="http://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer" rel="nofollow">http://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer</a></p>
