&lt;p&gt;As long as Walmart is the only victim (never fear, they won&#39;t go bankrupt for that matter) this scam is somehow amusing!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

	Interesting, This is a perfect example of INTERNET security. If Tor users that are trying to be hidden from view of prying Internet eyes are being sent scam mail than it goes to show that there is a big question mark about the security of the networks and computers they are using. My concern is how does one find the details of the individual or individuals that are using Tor. Is my understanding of this correct? Tor users are being sent fake prize winners tickets. So is someone targeting those whom are paranoid about spy and ID hacks. Obviously Tor did not work for the recipients of these scam lottery tickets. I commented about Google funding the Tor project and some concerns expressed about  this. In the real world peoples IP addresses can lead to their personal details such as mailing address so that fake lotteries tickets can be sent to them. This would mean that the individual responsible can obtain these from the ISP? That would be a major breach of privacy would it not? As if my IP address is 192.168.0.1 for example this would be like my home address. How ever this IP is common for a lot of devices like routers. Then the ISP I P address say 58.199.256.151 (example) would reveal the ISP name and registered address. So how does the persons PC NIC address and the details from that get to be known unless some one has the capability to get into the customer files from the Server (ISP) account holder? Or how does one find the address of the person using Tor, to send a fake lottery ticket to your e mail or door? By discovering your email address. From the ISP, hacking into your computer or the registered applications on your PC say if you fill in the registration form and place your details in the boxes? Could there be a fake Tor site or is the Tor web site infected with a spy ware bug? My mind boggles.

	&lt;p&gt;This has nothing to do with Tor users.  Many of the victims that contacted us can barely use a computer, nevermind worry about their privacy online.  It seems someone is just trolling for public information and sending out letters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few of the victims thought we were an ISP that bought their information from some mailing list and this was our way of advertising/getting them to contact us so we could pitch our product at them.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;also in the wake of internet censorship and a continuous trend towards our freedoms online being curtailed by western governments this may be a form of attack on Tor because you are an obstacle in the way of the police state future of the internet that they intend to bring into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;check out the digital econemy bill in the UK&lt;br /&gt;
and the fight going on in Australia &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Sounds like your Tor client is connecting out to a variety of Tor relays on various ports -- as expected. Each Tor relay chooses what port it wants to listen to, and some of them choose ports that are commonly used for pops, imaps, etc. So your poorly written firewall is misinterpreting the behavior and thinking it&#39;s making a pops connection, when actually it&#39;s just making a connection to that port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless of course you configured something else entirely. &lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost/jmtodaro/tor/blog/posts/You_have_won_the_Tor_sweepstakes_and_other_scams/../../smileys/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	No, you cannot get skype to use Tor.  Skype is UDP, tor is TCP only.
