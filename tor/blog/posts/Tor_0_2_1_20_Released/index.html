<a href="">Tor 0.2.1.20 Released</a>

</span>


<div id="content">
<p>Tor 0.2.1.20 fixes a crash bug when you're accessing many hidden services<br />
at once, prepares for more performance improvements, and fixes a bunch<br />
of smaller bugs.</p>

<p>The Windows and OS X bundles also include a more recent Vidalia, and<br />
switch from Privoxy to Polipo.</p>

<p>The OS X installers are now drag and drop. It's best to un-install<br />
Tor/Vidalia and then install this new bundle, rather than upgrade. If<br />
you want to upgrade, you'll need to update the paths for Tor and Polipo<br />
in the Vidalia Settings window.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download" title="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download" rel="nofollow">https://www.torproject.org/easy-download</a></p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.1.20 - 2009-10-15<br />
  o Major bugfixes:</p>

<p>    - Send circuit or stream sendme cells when our window has decreased<br />
      by 100 cells, not when it has decreased by 101 cells. Bug uncovered<br />
      by Karsten when testing the "reduce circuit window" performance<br />

      before the release of Tor 0.0.0. This is the new winner of the <span class="read-more"><a href="http://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-02120-released"><strong>read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</strong></a></span></p>

I had to uninstall polwhatever and go back to privoxy from the previous package. I wasted an hour on it. Changing two ports in it configuration renders it a dead duck. It listens on them but doesn't forward to tor. Maybe the ports are hardcoded in the binary? I disabled firewall, ran Wireshark, nothing going on.

<div class="inlinecontent">
<p>hello,</p>

<p>About polipo, i have the same problem, if i load a few pages in same time, it hang on or really slow.. </p>

<p>From privoxy 3.0.13 , i never have performance problem, no more timeout or like  early, no more message thatŝ it can't open a page.<br />
I don't see any advantage with polipo actually. Anyway all must free to use what there like <img src="../../smileys/smile.png" alt=":)" /></p>

<p>Actually i don't like the idea of polipo as preferred proxy for Tor since privoxy are more quick and don't do problem..</p>

<p>It will interesting  to really compare both product but only from recent version and see if polipo are really better. All my tests put privoxy up the list <img src="../../smileys/smile4.png" alt=";)" /></p>

<p>Best regards</p>

<p>The reason why Privoxy was used wasn't anonymity?<br />
Developers please give a statetment why it is save not to use Privoxy any more.<br />
(Or add Privoxy back again)</p>

<p>If it's just performance what you want, simply don't use Tor! <img src="../../smileys/smile4.png" alt=";-)" /></p>

<p>privoxy and polipo have nothing to do with anonymity, merely work arounds to broken firefox socks layer,http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Aug-2009/msg00188.html</p>

<p>Andrew has stated at least THREE TIMES that if firefox socks wasn't broken, tor wouldn't ship polipo or privoxy.  firefox memory cache works just fine, including polipo and privoxy are KLUDGES to FIREFOX'S CRAPPY CODE.</p>

<p>maybe chrome is better, or maybe chrome is laden with google spyware</p>

Good to see that open source is just like closed source.  Bugs as old as time are left in with nobody to fix them.  lol...  Although, I guess those with some programming skillz should send in a patch because Mozilla sure as hell ain't gonna fix it.

Some people have submitted patches over the years. Mozilla hasn't included them or accepted the patches for various reasons.  If we start to compile our own firefox, then we'll include the socks layer patches.  However, maintaining our own version of firefox isn't a task we can take on right now.

Well, that blows.  Somebody is fixing your buggy software for free and they reject the offer?  Unless the code sucks, I see no reason why they would do this.  Better yet, if they don't like the submitted fixes, why don't they just fix it themselves?  Sends a bad message that they don't care about security.  Well, I kinda figure that since they allowed some addons to install without user intervention...

<div class="inlinecontent">
<p>Whatever you have done to TOR you have broken it.  I installed the new version with Polipo and let it run for several hours and it never connected to TOR.  I replaced the cache files with the ones from my old installation and it finally connected.  But I could not reach any hidden services other than the core.onion.  Half the time it could not find an exit node.  I uninstalled and reinstalled the older version with Privoxy and it connected with no problem</p>

<p>Ever since the release, even the older version of TOR has problems finding hidden services, and exit nodes.  Plus it is slow to the point of useless now. My guess is that it's because you moved the directory/rendezvous servers, but I'm not a programmer so that's just a guess.</p>

<p>I realize that it's free, but some of us have come to depend on it, and now are in a bind because it doesn't work any more.</p>

<p>I've used TOR for many years now, and for the first time I'm very disappointed in it.</p>

<p>We make Tor.  I don't know what is TOR. Our testing of the network from various clients shows Tor is getting faster with each release of 0.2.1.x and 0.2.2.x-alpha.  Perhaps you had a poor circuit.</p>

<p>And for the record, I do 99.9% of my internet access through Tor, so I get to experience anything going wrong firsthand.</p>

<p>If you disable the proxy, and simply went through browser to Tor directly, do you still have the same problems?</p>

<p>I have the exact same issue. I've tried it on 2 Mac computers, one running 10.4 and one 10.5. I drop the package in after doing a full uninstall (even deleted .tor from my home folder), and I get absolutely nothing going on.</p>

<p>Also, the Tor Firefox plugin doesn't seem to know about polipo's new port, which I guess has changed to 8123?</p>

<p>The issue where our computers time may be off is shown to be known with  the program's auto announcement of it. I have never found my computer's time to be off so what does the problem tell the layman to do? </p>

<p>What do I do and when does the announced possible tor will not work happen?</p>

<p>Thanks for what you do.</p>

If your computer's time is correct, it's possible one of the relays has incorrect time and is causing the error to show up.  If you know your time is correct, ignore the warning.

<p>Polipo will stall after 32MB on a http download.<br />
If your using SSL or torrents or some other protocol then polipo is just relaying the connection and not really doing any processing on it like it does with http so is unaffected.</p>

<p>I've installed 0.2.1.20 cleanly on a brand new laptop.<br />
What bothers me is kind of strange behavior which I never experienced with the earlier versions.<br />
All the routs start with only 2 nodes. When you changed route, the nodes stayed the same.<br />
If I excluded these nodes and re-started Tor, the same picture could be observed with other two: routes changed but the entry guards are stay the same.<br />
Somehow, if I wiped out Tor cache (C:\Documents and Settings\%username%\Application Data\Tor\ or C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Tor\), it's reinitialized normally.<br />
What is it? Why 0.2.1.20 works such differently than previous version?</p>

<p>I thought the new Tor bundle was broken since I could no longer connect after installing it. It turned out that the problem were the bridges. I had to many bridges (7 out of 10 total) that were unreachable. After I removed the unreachable bridges, Tor worked again.<br />
So, before you add a bridge, better do a ping before.</p>

<p>polipo is listening on port 8123, so i did replace 8118 by 8123 in Torbutton prefs, to no avail. Does it ring a bell ?</p>

<p>Same...  uninstalled the old version, verified that no files existed from the old version, installed new version clean.  Torbutton test fails, torproject test page says I'm not using TOR, cannot reach any hidden services.  whatsmyipaddress.com shows that my ip address is changing, so it appears that traffic is going through the TOR network.</p>

<p>Phobos, is this a known issue?  Is this a config option that we need to change?  Is it just me?  Come on you guys, help us!</p>

Ugh, I'm having the same problems. I've removed those directories, the .app, and even did a find / -name '*Tor*' and find / -name 'tor*' (plus the same for privoxy) to get rid of the cruft. The drop-in application bundle still isn't working for me at all.

<p>This might not be the place for this, but I can't exclude nodes with ExcludeNodes or ExcludeExitNodes in torrc. My tor just won't do what it's told.<br />
This comes up in the vidalia message log:</p>

That is certainly not an exclusive 0.2.1.20 issue. I remain on 0.2.1.19 for now and experience this using ExcludeExitNodes. I believe it to go back much further (forever maybe). I suspect that there is logic that Tor will only honor this request if enough nodes exists outside the excluded zones for it to carry on its normal business. Having said that, it +appears+ to me that the result is some prioritization, i.e., fewer nodes in the excluded zones utilized than without the argument, but that could be wishful thinking. If nothing else, it gives me an easy to read list in the message log showing me which nodes that I have tried to exclude are used, and that could ultimately have some value.

I had downloaded and installed Tor Windows bundles before but the bundles always ran slower than Tor and Privoxy unbundled ( on my computer ). I uninstalled Tor ver.19 and downloaded and installed ver.20 but kept my Privoxy ver.12. No problems with Tor ver.20 with Privoxy ver.12, actually seems to run slightly faster than Tor ver.19. Privoxy hasn't had a new stable version since ver.12. Versions .13,.14 and .15 have all been betas. I have no complaints with Privoxy, but makes me wonder why so many betas and no new stable version? I run Tor on Win XP Pro. sp 3, using Firefox 3.5.5 and K-Meleon 1.5.3.

I wouldn't expect there to be any problems with privoxy and tor.  They are two indepdent applications.  So long as privoxy is setup to forward to Tor, it should work.  You should ask the privoxy people why they have so many betas.

<p>I downloaded TOR, the bundled version with Polipo, which I then uninstalled Polipo and installed Privoxy v 3.0.15. on Windows Server 2008 Enterprise edition. TOR starts and is successful creating a circuit. Firefox 3.5 page shows TOR as enabled, but when I check my TOR configuration at www.check.torproject.org, it reads: " You Are Not Using TOR". When I test the settings in the options of the TOR button I get "  Local HTTP Proxy is unreachable. Is Polipo running properly? " I have Privoxy specified to start when TOR starts with the application directory path in the Vidalia interface settings. I've tried everything that I won't attempt to publish here and still no luck. What am I missing here?<br />
Any feedback is greatly appreciated!</p>

Can someone from the development team explain in technical terms why the proxy server (Privoxy or anyother) is/was needed to be used with tor? I remember it had something to do with the DNS request leaks, correct? Is it still a problem? If other than Firefox browser is used, let's say Opera, is it still necessary to  use proxy server (Privoxy, Polipo, etc.) to maintain true anonymity? Sorry, I could not find the definitive answer in the documentation.

<div class="inlinecontent">
<p>An http proxy is not needed between a web browser and Tor for functionality.  It's there to work around bugs in the Firefox SOCKS layer.  In modern firefox 3.0 and newer, there is an option called "network.proxy.socks_remote_dns" that is set by torbutton. This forces dns lookups over the configured socks proxy server, which with torbutton, is Tor.</p>

<p>Other apps may leak dns requests, these can be captured by setting a DNSPort or iptables tricks, or using a proxy between the app and tor.  </p>

<p>Polipo and Privoxy can be used to work around the hardcoded timeouts in the firefox socks layers.  If you don't use firefox, then feel free to configure your browser to talk directly to tor as a socks 5 proxy.  Just test to see if the browser leaks dns requests.</p>

Is the socks layer problem particular to only Firefox? Or is it a problem with any browser that uses the Gecko Runtime Engine  ( Seamonkey, K-Meleon, Flock, Camino, Lunascape, etc. )?

Unsure.  From what I understand of Gecko, no.  Gecko handles the html parsing, not the network interaction.  I may be wrong, feel free to correct me.

<div class="inlinecontent">
<p>I have used the Tor Macosx bundle for two years+. I am<br />
an ordinary user. I thank the Tor project managers for<br />
ceaselessly trying to make this excellent software simpler<br />
and usable by people like me. I try to learn about it all the<br />
time by constantly referring to its documentation but I do<br />
not understand the technical aspect of it.</p>

<p>I am having difficulties with the latest bundle which has<br />
replaced Privoxy with Polipo. At the moment I have Polipo,<br />
tor, Vidalia located in Vidalia.app/Contents. I also have<br />
Vidalia, tor, Torbutton, Privoxy folders in Macintosh HD/<br />
Library. The tor version is 0.2.1.20, Qt 4.3.5. Vidalia 0.2.5.</p>

<p>The Torbutton (excellent extension!) works well with Privoxy<br />
- no problems but when I change to 'new proxy' by replacing<br />
Port 8118 to 8123 (Polipo's port) to try it, tor does not work<br />
because when I check my IP it is my real IP with info on my<br />
default browser etc! When I use the Test Button in Torbutton<br />
Preferences I get an 'Internal Error' or sometimes 'Test failed'.<br />
It seems that the requests I make are not going tor.</p>

<p>My OS is osx 10.5.8. I thank in advance anyone who is able to<br />
help me try this new proxy - Polipo.</p>

<p>My current 'tor settings' are:<br />
/Applications/Vidalia.app/Contents/MacOS/tor<br />
/Applications/Vidalia.app/Contents/MacOs/polipo</p>

<p>and yet Torbutton is configured to use Privoxy.....and<br />
it is working OK!</p>

<p>Thanks again</p>

<p>Uluru</p>

If you are using our packages, we reconfigure polipo to work on port 8118. Look at the polipo config file installed on your system.

Yes, it's an open bug.  You could run the PowerPC binary for now.  It seems the latest OS X update to leopard broke backwards compatibility.

The same with me (Windows Vista Home Basic, Internet Explorer 8). The settings for the proxy server in Options are 127.0.0.1, port 8118, but I cannot connect to any site. The previous version works fine. It's the second time I'm trying to start working with the new version of Tor, the first time I have uninstalled it and returned to the previous version. Help, please.

<p>We've responded at least 5 times as to why we switched.  Polipo is caching, supports http 1.1 pipelining, and is currently maintained.</p>

<p>If you don't like polipo, don't use it.  Setup Firefox or your favorite browser to point directly at localhost:9050.  The default configuration is well-tested.  Sorry it didn't work for you as you expected.</p>

<p>Serious Problem: Tor 0.2.1.20 and Mac OSX 10.4.11</p>

<p>I've been using the Tor bundle for the last year with no problem.  A couple of days ago I was prompted to upgrade to the the new version of the package.  I duly did the upgrade and replaced the existing Vidalia package with the new version in my Applications folder.  When I clicked to open the package, nothing at all happened.  I then read that it was better to uninstall the package before downloading the new one.  So I followed the uninstall instructions on the torproject website, deleting all trace of Tor, Vidalie etc on my system (applications, library).  I then downloaded the new version of the package again.  I dragged the package into the applications folder and then tried to open it.  Very briefly the onion icon flashed up on the dock but then immediately disappeared.  Then nothing else.  I cannot make the package work.  Can anyone help?  I live in a country where many normal websites are blocked including the BBC. So without Tor I am cut off.  Thanks.</p>

<p>Regression: Tor 0.2.1.20 on OS X 10.6.2</p>

<p>I had been using Tor 0.2.19 for more than half a year and it worked well. Then I upgraded to Tor 0.2.1.20 early this month. And then 0.2.1.20 worked fine for a while. Then it always failed with "Problem bootstrapping. Stuck at 10%: Finishing handshake with directory server." Then I downgraded to 0.2.1.19 by reinstalling the old package, and everything works again. Then I reinstall 0.2.1.20 and this time it works well for about three days and then "Stuck at 10%" again.</p>

<p>Now I downgraded to 0.2.1.19 again and I think I am stuck with it until the problem is fixed in some later version.</p>

Supplement: When I was and am using 0.2.1.19, I using bridges because of ISP's blocking of Tor. When I switched to 0.2.1.20 and during its normal first two or three days, it worked regardless whether the bridges are configured or not. So I suspect maybe some misconfiguration in 0.2.1.20 package (or Vidalia) make the bridge configuration disabled even when it is configured on the UI.

No, it seems irrelative to the location, because everything on my MacBook Pro are the same except Tor version. I mean, the same environment, when upgrade to 0.2.1.20, fail, downgrade to 0.2.1.19, success. There are the same bridges, and the result is different by different Tor versions. It's hardly the problem of blocking.

I am experencing the same problem. I don't think it has anything to do with the tor bridge, since i have the same configuration of tor bridges on both my pc and mac. Tor works well on my pc (0.2.1.19) with bridges, but does not on my mac (0.2.1.21 or 0.2.1.22) with the same bridges set. I believe it's a bug in 0.2.1.20 and any newer versions of tor (mac osx)

<div class="inlinecontent">
I downloaded TOR, the bundled version with Polipo, which I then uninstalled Polipo and installed Privoxy v 3.0.15. on Windows Server 2008 Enterprise edition. TOR starts and is successful creating a circuit. Firefox 3.5 browser page shows that TOR is enabled, but when I check my TOR configuration at www.check.torproject.org, it reads, " You Are Not Using TOR". When I test the settings in the options of the TOR button I get "Local HTTP Proxy is unreachable. Is Polipo running properly?". I have Privoxy specified to start when TOR starts via the directory path in the Vidalia interface settings. I'm not sure why it keeps referring to Polipo.I'm not sure why TOR seems to being working but is not being used by my browser. When I check the status of Privoxy, it checks out as successful.What am I missing here? Any feedback is greatly appreciated!

I admit that I am quite ignorant of how it all works, but so far, It works excellent for me in all my browsing. Impressive and Fascinating to say the least!</p>

<p>I am running Win XP home and of course the Firefox included in the bundle.<br />
When I log on MyBrowserInfo.com, it reads my UserAgent String, although the IP address is random (So cool!)<br />
Just one question: hopefully a simple one due to my ignorance:<br />
How can I configure to hide my UserAgent String?</p>

<p>Thanks for a Great Network and for an answer...</p>

<p>Oops, I broke it!</p>

<p>So there are people that really know what they're doing, and then on the other side, there's me. <img src="../../smileys/ohwell.png" alt=":/" />   I installed Tor and Polipo in an attempt to attain some privacy. Specifically, I wanted to appear to have a different IP each time I visited a particular site (most votes win, IP tracking in use). Anyhow, I don't think I achieved what I was after and so I uninstalled both Tor and Polipo. I reinstalled privoxy and thought life would be back to normal. Now, my browser is incredibly slow. REALLY slow. So now I am humbled and am sheepishly asking for help as I realize I was medling where I didn't belong. Any suggestions toward restoring my previous browser speed would be very appreciated. Thanks</p>

You may want to put back the original privoxy config, or uninstall privoxy and reinstall it so you get the fresh configuration file.

I installed Opera and TOR bundled, with Polipo included in the download archive. Installation required just one click on a button, was incredibly easy and OPERA &amp; TOR began working immediately without any problems, unlike Firefox &amp; TOR which just gave an http error message and stopped with a blank screen.

Good luck then.  The Tor Browser Bundle is designed to work the same way.  We're working on bringing this to all operating systems.  Microsoft Windows and Linuxes already exist.

Polipo doesn`t support downloading more than 30mb.the reason i use tor is to enable downloading above 150mb which is blcoked in our firewall.Please reconsider about this and develop privoxy instead of polipo. now i am back to old version with privoxy.Hoping a good response in next update

Polipo supports downloading gigabytes of data.  There's a bug where polipo will fill up the memory cache and stop the download, rather than continue on.  I've been able to download 10GBs of linux isos through polipo just fine.  It seems the bug shows up on Windows more than not.  Privoxy is too slow and doesn't support http 1.1 for two reasons why we switched.  The real question is why do we need a http proxy at all?

Hello, I am running Tor v.0.2.1.22 with firefox 3.0.19 and Torbutton 1.2.5. I have been able to browse/download/upload fine with Tor enabled up until today, when I get firefox message 'proxy server refused connection'. Tor is able to establish circuit through c-prompt. Firefox connection setting is set to 'No Proxy'. I have tried changing this to 'auto-detect proxy', no difference. I have tried changing the Torbutton setting to 'use custom proxy settings' that did not work. I am fairly certain the only thing that could have changed was an updating of firefox. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thx.

what exactly did you download, the tor browser bundle or the vidalia bundle?  the tor browser bundle doesn't install anything, it's self-contained.  Just click "Start Tor Browser" and everything else works by default.
