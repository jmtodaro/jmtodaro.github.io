	&lt;p&gt;Well, this is probably your biggest problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our clock is 23 hours, 30 minutes behind the time published in the consensus network status document (2009-08-06 11:00:00 GMT). Tor needs an accurate clock to work correctly. Please check your time and date settings!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you should fix your clock first.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Now it is very hard to connect to Tor Network in China.&lt;br /&gt;
Once i can connect, i hope to be a Tor Bridge Relay, to help other people can connect to Tor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have set Vidalia/Sharing to &#39;Help censored user reach the Tor network&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;
But my log tell me, i don&#39;t config the firewall well.&lt;br /&gt;
I wonder i have added those ports on my WinXP SP3 Firewall Exceptions already,&lt;br /&gt;
but the problem is continue.&lt;br /&gt;
i am sure that there is no other firewall software in my computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does china block me from become a Tor Relay?&lt;br /&gt;
Here is the Log (I modifed my IP )&lt;br /&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Opps, i just realize that&lt;br /&gt;
Tor bundle browser version which i am using is out-date.&lt;br /&gt;
because google link me to&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.torproject.org/download.html.en&quot; title=&quot;http://www.torproject.org/download.html.en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.torproject.org/download.html.en&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but latest version is at&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.torproject.org/easy-download.html.en&quot; title=&quot;http://www.torproject.org/easy-download.html.en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.torproject.org/easy-download.html.en&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;it seem both is newest version,&lt;br /&gt;
the number is just tell it is stable or un-stable version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today i still can connect to Tor.&lt;br /&gt;
but Becoming Tor Relay problem still continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know how to self-check as i wish (not to wait for 20 min)?&lt;br /&gt;
so i can test immediately if i re-config my firewall well.&lt;br /&gt;
or any idea how to track the problem?&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Hi&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m in Oman which blocks sites like Skype, Tor, etc.  I&#39;ve tried inserting several bridges, but Vidalia never connects.  The status stops about 1/3 way through with the message &quot;establishing an encrypted directory connection failed (done)&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
The log shows:&lt;br /&gt;
Problem bootstrapping. Stuck at 10%: Finishing handshake with directory server. (Socket is not connected [WSAENOTCONN ]; NOROUTE;&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m using PortableTor - Portable Vidalia Bundle - Version 0.2.1.19, but have tried several other versions as well, with the same result.&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for any help you can give.&lt;/p&gt;

	The problem on Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.2 is from a bundled security update affecting the Mac implementation of OpenSSH, the program that is used to create secure connections to peers on the Tor network.  The only known work-around involves installing the correct libraries from MacPorts and compiling Tor to use those rather than the default mac ones. Then one would have to point the Vidalia configuration to the newly compiled Tor.  Several people have reported that this works, but it is certainly more technically demanding.  The details can be found here: https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-stable-released-tor-02121  Look about 3/4&#39;s of the way down the page.

	&lt;p&gt;I am using Vidalia version 0.2.6. I have set the proxy and bridge (because my ISP blocks connections to the TOR network). Unfortunately, I am getting the following status:&lt;br /&gt;

Furthermore, the message log shows the following:&lt;br /&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Pretty pitiful that NOT A SINGLE SUGGESTION has been made for this critical problem in over 4 months. although it is clear that the sparkies over at the GFW have made some changes that wipe any references to the TOR network including the certificate references and, of course, ports and IP Address. I can add new bridges every ten minutes and none get recognized, in fact, the error log sees them as been &quot;dangerous&quot; and rejects the connection but NOW it just can&#39;t find any bridge routes, period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though this is a bad situation gone catastrophic, you would think that someone on the TOR side of the fence would have something to say about it, even if its just a &quot;like to help but can&#39;t... &quot; but not a single response from any one on the TOR team? WTF is that all about?&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;There are tons of responses by us.  Our research from within China shows the GFW is blocking ip:port combinations of the public relays and the bridges available by our bridge website.  There are comments littered throughout this blog about tor bridges and china.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re experimenting with other means of access inside china, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://metrics.torproject.org/bridge-users-graphs.html#china&quot; title=&quot;http://metrics.torproject.org/bridge-users-graphs.html#china&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://metrics.torproject.org/bridge-users-graphs.html#china&lt;/a&gt; for the results so far.  A few thousand people continue to connect without issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s unclear what you mean by &quot;error log sees them as dangerous&quot;, that&#39;s not something in our code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s unclear what you mean by &quot;GFW have made some changes that wipe any references to the TOR network including the certificate references&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

   lots of people under the GFW are pitifully ungreatful bastards, i think it&#39;s a bit about the environment here. i haven&#39;t been on my facebook account for something like 6 months now, i hope one day i can see it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for those who have their freedom limited by choices they make or by accident of birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;continue to push, continue to fight, take what is yours, take what is right. &lt;/p&gt;
