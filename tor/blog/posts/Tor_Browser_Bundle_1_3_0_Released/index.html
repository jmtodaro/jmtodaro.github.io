<a href="">Tor Browser Bundle 1.3.0 Released</a>

</span>


<div id="content">
<p>On December 31, 2009, I released the latest in the Tor Browser Bundle series, 1.3.0.  The version bump from 1.2.10 to 1.3.0 is due to the change to Firefox 3.5.6 (from Firefox 3.0.15).  </p>

<p>You can get the latest TBB in 12 languages at <a href="https://www.torproject.org/torbrowser/" title="https://www.torproject.org/torbrowser/" rel="nofollow">https://www.torproject.org/torbrowser/</a></p>

<p>Torbutton 1.2.4 fixes a number of privacy and anonymity issues with the Firefox 3.5.x code base.</p>

<p>The official changelog is:</p>

<p>- upgrade Firefox to 3.5.6<br />
- update Pidgin to 2.6.4<br />
- update Torbutton to 1.2.4</p>

<p>Feel free to file bugs at<br />

Hello, I now running a Torbrowser from late last year and would like to know the difference between allowing only Tor and Firefox out the Zonealarm firewall, or in addition allow also the Vidalia and Polipo out the firewall? As far I can see, everything works fine with only Tor and Firefox, and the rest blocked in Zonealarm. Thanks for a good prog!

if you use the same software we do, portable pidgin, yes.  Or rather than going through all that, just use the latest bundle which has all of the updates in it.

<p>1.) I think it may be easier to just update FF and my add-ons (NoScript, ABP and Tor Button) than having to install them from scratch, along with all of my personal settings and preferences. </p>

<p>I don’t use Pidgin yet.</p>

<p>2.) I learned the hard way that one needs to disable Tor before updating Firefox or add-ons (or at least before restarting once updates have downloaded).</p>

<p>I wanted to share this for the benefit of others. </p>

<p>3.) Can people assume that barring something unforseen that may occur,  it will be safe to update to Firefox 3.5.7 when it becomes available? (and so on, until the next build)</p>

<p>Thanks again for everything. The Bundle is quite impressive.</p>

There is one person working on torbutton.  Torbutton may work for Firefox 3.5.7 when it is released, but generally, assuming something may have changed and we need to review the code changes first.  This takes time.  We're happy to have more help in keeping up with the changes.

<div class="inlinecontent">
<p>Thank you again for replying.</p>

<p>I did not mean to convey impatience or pressure in any way and I’m sorry if you took me that way.</p>

<p>I appreciate the non-profit nature of the project and the dedication of the volunteers who make it possible for and allow anyone to benefit from their work. </p>

<p>I was merely _asking_ whether or not one should apply updates to Firefox and add-ons as they become available. </p>

<p>“assuming something may have changed and we need to review the code changes first.”</p>

<p>Is it just Firefox, then, that one should never update without being certain? What about add-ons? And the other components of the bundle; was I wrong to update Tor Button at the prompting of Firefox before the next bundle had been released? (From your reply, it seems I should _not_ have updated Firefox to 3.0.16 but how was I to know?)</p>

<p>Again, please don’t take this the wrong way; I mean no pressure or lack of gratitude but isn’t this essential, basic information that should be stated clearly and prominently in a place such as the download page itself?</p>

<p>I am certain that I am not alone in not finding this clear at all and in my searching, I actually did come across one or more other posts asking this very question but no answers.</p>

<p>And, finally, if there is a forum that would be more appropriate for questions, it would be much appreciated if someone could post a link to it.</p>

<p>“We're happy to have more help in keeping up with the changes.”</p>

<p>I’m afraid I’m far from having such capabilities.</p>

<p>Sorry if I gave the impression of angst.  It was really meant as a statement of fact.  </p>

<p>As for updates, it depends how paranoid you are, or need to be, versus being secure with the latest updates.  Generally, minor upgrades are safe.  Firefox generally doesn't revamp the codebase between 3.5.6 and 3.5.7.  Mozilla generally just fixes bugs in minor point releases.</p>

<p>For more paranoid users, read through the changelog to see what fixes were applied and new features added.  Sometimes, there are changes that cause torbutton to fail.  you may never know about them unless you start parsing the code yourself.  Or setting up torbutton in full debug logging mode.</p>

<p>We are working on a forum. It should be ready soon.</p>

Regarding FF extensions and settings: Chuck Baker maintains three FF extensions named FEBE, CLEO and OPIE. Those extensions allow you to back-up your FF environment (FEBE), selectively package extensions (CLEO) and export and import extension preferences (OPIE). This functionality does not work perfectly for all extensions, but it works far more often than not. Baker's tools are invaluable in cloning FF behavior between unique installs, and I highly recommend them for use in a TBB/PFF upgrade.

<p>This comment is unrelated to this post but I am not aware of a TOR forum and I really don't know how to get in touch with your developers.</p>

<p>I just wanted to say that <a href="https://check.torproject.org/cgi-bin/TorBulkExitList.py" title="https://check.torproject.org/cgi-bin/TorBulkExitList.py" rel="nofollow">https://check.torproject.org/cgi-bin/TorBulkExitList.py</a></p>

<p>Is not working correctly. For the past few weeks it has been incredibly unresponsive and often throws out python errors instead of an actual blocklist. I would very much like to host this python script locally but I cannot find any instructions on how to run it and my webhost wont execute it for some reason (although they will execute normal python 'hello world' scripts so that has me baffled).</p>

<p>Just thought I'd let ya know <img src="../../smileys/smile.png" alt=":)" /></p>

<p>Right. We've been migrating the services from one box to another, and we got stuck half-way through.</p>

<p>Specifically, there are two services involved -- check.tp.o, and exitlist.tp.o. If you put them on locations far apart from each other, it turns out things degrade in surprising ways.</p>

<p>I've put them both back together on the old location for now. Hopefully that won't kill our incentive to move them to the new, more robust location. <img src="../../smileys/smile.png" alt=":)" /></p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>1.) What about a GNU+Linux Live CD (or USB Flash) w/ Tor Browser Bundle built-in? </p>

<p>2.) Some strange behavior of <a href="https://check.torproject.org" title="https://check.torproject.org" rel="nofollow">https://check.torproject.org</a> I've experienced:</p>

<p>- defaults to<br />

<p>- will a # of times show a _dif._ IP than sites such as ipid.shat.net , cmyip.com and whatismyipaddress.com</p>

<p>- will sometimes say "Sorry, you are not using Tor", yet nonetheless show an IP I am sure is dif. from my real one.</p>

<p>1) There are a few, the best right now is incognito, <a href="http://anonymityanywhere.com/incognito/" title="http://anonymityanywhere.com/incognito/" rel="nofollow">http://anonymityanywhere.com/incognito/</a>.</p>

<p>2) this is a font problem between firefox and your system.</p>

<p>3) this is how circuits work, you get different circuits over time, so you should see different IP addresses.</p>

<p>4) yes, it's possible to get false negatives.  check is running a standard tor client and the python code checks against the cached-consensus file.  new relays that aren't in the consensus can result in a false negative.</p>

<div class="inlinecontent">
<p>1.) Latest Incognito version appears to be June 2009 (beta) yet all Tor Browser Bundle components have been updated several times since then.</p>

<p>I’ve searched but have not found anything else that appears maintained/current. </p>

<p>This seems surprising, when one considers that:<br />
-Tor Browser Bundle is designed for [i]Windows[/i]</p>

<p>- The odds that any given system running Windows is infected with malware are high</p>

<p>- Running TBB from a Live *nix environment would, presumably, circumvent not only any malware that may already be present on the host OS (excluding something like a hardware keylogger, of course) but also the many vulnerabilities inherent to any system running Windows.</p>

<p>2.) Problem seems to be exclusive to <a href="https://check.torproject.org" title="https://check.torproject.org" rel="nofollow">https://check.torproject.org</a> ; don’t have it at other sites.</p>

<p>3.) Even when, after refreshing the pages several times, the IP shown at check.torproject.org is still different from that shown by other IP-check sites?</p>

<p>4.) Does that mean that even when <a href="https://check.torproject.org" title="https://check.torproject.org" rel="nofollow">https://check.torproject.org</a> says<br />
“you are not using Tor", as long as:<br />
a) the IP shown is not the one from one’s ISP (or LAN, etc.)<br />
and<br />
b) one is not using any other proxy,<br />
one is, in fact, using Tor?</p>

<p>Thank you for the detailed reply and all your work on the project.</p>

<p>1.  Incognito is maintained by volunteers.  They are happy to have additional help.  I believe they are switching the base operating system from gentoo to debian or ubuntu for future releases.  This is why not much has come out lately.</p>

<p>2.  Tor Browser Bundle was not designed for Windows.  Someone funded us to make TBB work on Windows, so we did it.  There is a TBB for Linux set of patches in svn, undergoing testing, and will eventually be maintained equivalently to the Windows TBB.  There's also the start of a TBB for OS X.</p>

<p>Building and compiling the software is one thing, doing the research to see what risks are created, and what signatures are left behind is far more intensive.  We're not going to ship anything for linux nor osx until we know what is left behind.  We'll work to minimize traces and then work to remove them on exit of the app.</p>

<p>3.  Circuits rotate.  This is why your exit IP shows up different for each refresh over time.  Different sites may get pushed to different circuits, so the IP address the site reports will be different.</p>

<p>I appreciate the detailed reply and took note of the explanation, clarification and corrections it contained.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the work of the all the volunteers and, as with my previous posts, I did not mean to complain or pressure but was merely _inquiring_  and expressing some thoughts and concerns.</p>

<p>I realize it is probably beyond the scope of this blog to elaborate in detail but perhaps someone could just clarify whether or not there is a way to safely use Incognito or a similar distro at this point.  Presumably,  one would need to update all of the individual components?</p>

<p>Perhaps someone can provide a link for more information on this.</p>

<p>Thank you again (to all).</p>

<p>NOTE: The system ignored all paragraph breaks in my previous post. I therefore added two extra lines b/w each paragraph to this post.</p>

<p>updating incognito is a plausible step if you are already familiar with building your own linux distribution.  If not, it's safer to wait.  </p>

<p>My point about the volunteers running incognito isn't to apply pressure, it's just that we're dependent on them to update the software.  In a perfect world, we'd have this automated, so all updates magically rolled into incognito every night and a shiny iso was waiting for download in the morning.</p>

<p>Thanks for having the new version ready before the end of support for Firefox 3 and for all your work.</p>

<p>A problem I've had a lot when using 1.2.10 is that my posts to forums, including this one, do not appear -- even with multiple page refreshes-- until much later. </p>

<p>I know it has to be a problem w/ something in the TBB, because the same posts do appear immediately when using FF without Tor or even sometimes when using a web-proxy via FF _within_ TBB.</p>

<p>I'm having issues with random crashes and unexpected proxy timeouts with the new bundle on Windows. I simply had to revert to the version based on Firefox 3.0.13. What seems to make things go haywire is when changing the referer-settings in Firefox.<br />
When I change the environment variables (about:config) to:<br />
network.http.sendRefererHeader;0<br />
network.http.sendSecureXSiteReferrer;false<br />
...the browser either crashes on exit or starts with Tor button diable the next time the browser/bundle is restarted. The value of:<br />
extensions.torbutton.disable_referer;true<br />
doesn't seem to have any effect on preventing refferer data to be sent (according to torcheck.xenobyte.eu).</p>

<p>It seems to me that something is wrong with the browser (3.5.6) in the new bundle.<br />
Are the above problems known issues? </p>

Yeah I'm running Windows XP as well and have FireFox. Personally, I don't think Tor is a stable platform to run on windows XP. I downloaded it/ran it and it crashed my computer (blue screen of death) multiple times before I was able to get it up and running again. I've read in other forums that loads of people running xp cant seem to keep this program stable. I'm not saying there are not you lucky few that can get it to work I'm just saying more people can't get it to work as advertised. As for me; thanks but no thanks. Don't know what else to tell you bro, do an update on your xp and maybe you can download tor. You do have to save the file but you should also be able to open the file as well; there should not be "open with" when opening. Good luck, I hope it works for you.

<p>Tor or any of the browser bundle programs should not crash your Windows computer by themselves .  If you get blue screens, check for:<br />
1) bad RAM<br />
2) hard disk errors<br />
3) viruses or other malware<br />
4) leftover or badly behaving security software<br />
5) missing Windows updates</p>

This is odd, because I do all the development and testing on Windows XP SP3.  I personally bought and donated the WinXP licenses to Tor.  Microsoft recently donated Windows 7 to us, but it comes with some draconian legal agreements we're not happy about; so we may return the donation.

thanks for your noble efforts. Will you consider creating a blacklist feature that prevents visits to specified websites unless Torbutton is active? That would prevent slip-ups by users.

No.  For the same reason Internet censorship by domain names and Ip addresses is a futile task, blacklisting the bad is the same sort of task.  It won't work, and sites you may trust get infected and then you've lost.

<p>You should upgrade to Tor 0.2.1.22 or 0.2.2.7-alpha:<br />
https://www.torproject.org/download.html.en</p>

<p>In early January we discovered that two of the seven directory<br />
authorities were compromised (moria1 and gabelmoo), along with<br />
metrics.torproject.org, a new server we'd recently set up to serve<br />
metrics data and graphs. The three servers have since been reinstalled<br />
with service migrated to other servers.</p>

<p>We made fresh identity keys for the two directory authorities, which is<br />
why you need to upgrade.</p>

<p>I have had the green onion for years, thinking I was anonymous. I wasn't. My assumption was negligent. Tor had only established 3 "things" out of 5 needed. So I'm going to uninstall all the old TorVidaliaPrivoxy stuff and put the latest bundle in. Can I be assured that it will work now, for a dummy, (i can see the future but crap at maths)?<br />

<p>I like Tor. I run as a relay. I start up with the Firefox browser. But when I close Firefox, sometimes by mistake, then the relay stops working too.<br />
Is there a way to keep on relaying, when you close down Firefox?<br />
I can't seem to find that solution anywhere.<br />
Cheers.</p>

The behavior you're experiencing with Firefox is because you're using the Tor Browser Bundle. If you prefer not leaving Firefox open, you could instead install the Vidalia bundle. That bundle assumes that you have your own Firefox install.
