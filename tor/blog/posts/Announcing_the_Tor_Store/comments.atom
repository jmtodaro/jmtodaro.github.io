	&lt;p&gt;I really want to help Tor, but I have problems finding other independent sources to confirm Tor is safe protecting user&#39;s information. It would only make sense to help Tor if real protection to users details exists.&lt;br /&gt;
This article, for an example: http://www.lockergnome.com/izatt82/2008/07/18/you-are-not-safe-anymore-o... - says it is dangerous for users. I know it is an old publication (2006), and I am not a computer / code / security specialist but I guess it is more dangerous to think that you are safe than to know you are in danger.&lt;br /&gt;
There is very little information written by experts outside Tor pages. Can you advise on sources I could read?&lt;br /&gt;
I think it would be a great idea to get some business CTO&#39;s and university professors to express their fellings about Tor.&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Sorry, but these T-shirts are not something I&#39;d wear unless I was going to a geek-oriented event.  Tacking on the logo of a cool project on a shirt does not necessarily make good swag.  The onion itself would be cool, or perhaps a stylized form of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An artist creating something for a Tor t-shirt could leverage its &#39;badass&#39; image among the tech crowd, as it is often associated with dissidents in Iran and China.&lt;/p&gt;

	We release early and often.  This is a start.  I hope others come up with logos, designs, and things they want to see exist and send them to us.  If it&#39;s CC-BY licensed, we&#39;ll print it.
