	<description>It may just be my computer, but I&#39;m in China and am at the moment unable to connect to the Tor network.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It worked well up until today. I am now receiving a message in the message log which states: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;May 22 18:21:09.015 [Warning] No specified exit routers seem to be running, and StrictExitNodes is set: can&#39;t choose an exit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyone assist please?&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Check out&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#ChooseEntryExit&quot; title=&quot;https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#ChooseEntryExit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#ChooseEntryExi...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially the part where we suggest that you not use ExitNodes and&lt;br /&gt;
StrictExitNodes. They&#39;re easy to screw up and leave yourself in a broken&lt;br /&gt;
state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, &quot;stop doing that&quot; would be my suggestion. In the future we hope to&lt;br /&gt;
have a better interface for choosing your path (and/or exit) by country.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;What are you doing to increase security when nodes are chosen in anti privacy country&#39;s like Germany that starting on 1/1-2009 started to log information about from and to IPs and even worse 1/1-2009 Swedish espionage organization(FRA) started collecting &amp;amp; analysing a copy of all the data that passes the Swedish border !!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you plan to use 4 nodes in these circuits in the future with a maximum of 1 node in these country&#39;s or how do you withstand these intrusions of the personal integrity these country&#39;s started with ?&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;For the record, 1/1/2009 was nearly 6 months ago.  We hope you&#39;re using secure protocols through Tor such that the risks are lessened.  Someone watching any node will only see you&#39;re using Tor, or what IP address you&#39;re visiting from an exit node.  If an entry node, they&#39;ll know your IP.  If an exit node, they&#39;ll know where you are going.  In either case, they can&#39;t put who and what together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better question is what to do if your first and last node are in the same country, and I don&#39;t think we have an answer for that yet.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;For the record, 1/1/2009 was nearly 6 months ago.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Yes i know that. I only mention this as i understand that Tor has still not made a good solution to solve this problem that needs fixing.&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;We hope you&#39;re using secure protocols through Tor such that the risks are lessened.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Yes of course i am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;A better question is what to do if your first and last node are in the same country, and I don&#39;t think we have an answer for that yet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do know that country&#39;s like Germany, USA, Sweden and so on are sending these data to the other country&#39;s even if it&#39;s against there own laws so stopping circuits with 3 nodes in the same country(does this work yet, it wasn&#39;t before) or even first &amp;amp; last node as you mention is not enough as a measure against these data retention &amp;amp; collecting they have started with.&lt;br /&gt;
Tor&#39;s circuits needs to have at least 1 entry or exitnode out of there reach to be a safe solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would allow a maximum of 1 node from this group of country&#39;s who do this kind of things it would of cource improve security a lot for they who themselfs are not able to recofigure there torrc-file.&lt;br /&gt;
I understand that this could be a problem because a country like Germany has such a large portion of the Tor networks total bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cannot connect here in Okinawa. Kinda irritating really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potentially could be wifi router settings blocking specific ports, but is highly unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issue remains the same.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>My first thought from the &quot;3 missing key&quot; part is that you are using a very old Tor version. Which Tor version is this? And can you post the [gibberish key removed] parts, too? There&#39;s nothing secret in them, and maybe they help us resolve the problem.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Your program is actively being used to steal my internet band width to the point that we cannot operate our business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now have a timeswitch on the modem so the internet only runs during working hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need you to provide me a program so I have control over the service that I am paying for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember this if you are not doing something wrong then you dont need to hide what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the email I sent you earlier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for contacting us.  Did you install Tor?  If so, Tor has many&lt;br /&gt;
ways to control the amount of bandwidth consumed.  Many users donate&lt;br /&gt;
their unused bandwidth to help others who need their privacy and&lt;br /&gt;
anonymity online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt; I need you to provide me a program so I have control over the service&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; that I am paying for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can&#39;t provide you a program to control your ISP.  If you can tell me&lt;br /&gt;
what you installed, assuming it&#39;s tor, I can help you from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt; Just remember this if you are not doing something wrong then you&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; don&#39;t need to hide what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a false dichotomy.  There are many reasons to protect your&lt;br /&gt;
communications, or to provide some control over who collects information&lt;br /&gt;
about you on the Internet without your permission.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://torproject.org/torusers&quot; title=&quot;https://torproject.org/torusers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://torproject.org/torusers&lt;/a&gt; provides a few examples of users who&lt;br /&gt;
need their communications protected.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just installed the new Tor bundle with Firefox, and when I select &quot;View the Network&quot; from the Vidalia Control Panel, none of the country flags appear in the Relay column to the left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the Tor bundle before the recent Vidalia update, and the flags always appeared normally. (I ended up removing that bundle, and replacing it with the brand new one.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know -- is this a bug, or a temporary error in the network? I would rather not delete this new Vidalia bundle and start all over again, adding the add-ons, etc., if there is a simple fix for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATP&lt;/p&gt;
