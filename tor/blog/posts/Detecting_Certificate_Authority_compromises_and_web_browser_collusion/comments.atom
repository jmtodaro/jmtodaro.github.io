	The verification process for buying a certificate is a joke with most cert vendors. All they care about is the email address registered with the domain registrar. Hijack the domain and you can order yourself all the certs you want for the domain. Next, ISVs and so-called software consultants are constantly implementing code in orgs where certificates are explicitly trusted. Most commercial software developers treat certs as a liability. PKI is totally bankrupt as a trust service.

	Why do you think it&#39;s even important to validate the email address. An SSL cert is (or at least was) used for the sole purpose of making a site secure. It was never intended to assert the site owners identity, or their trustworthiness. The latter has only come to market with the launch of extended validation services.

	&lt;p&gt;This is not really true. Back in the &quot;good old days&quot; in 1994, EV-type stuff was the NORM. I got an SSL cert for Netscape Server from Verisign and it took about 2 weeks to get all the verifications in order. The truth is that CAs got greedy and loosened their processes. More than half of the sites out there get their certs issued in a matter of seconds...you can set up a reseller account and get certs issued on your clients&#39; behalf with essentially NO verification. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system relies on honesty, and someone was dishonest. I would imagine there was no exploitation here other than someone trying to get a cert for a high-value domain and succeeding. It was like brute force through multiple vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

	I think a lot of people would take issue with your statement that TLS is not meant to assert identity. This is why WebAppSec folk argue that a login page should be on an TLS supported page as opposed to only POSTing to an TLS supported page.

	TLS is for making a connection to a site secure, yes. That means you have to know you&#39;re talking to the site, and not some system in between. That in turn implies that you have to know that the cert belongs to the site, which implies validation. Drop that, and https is no better than http.

	You&#39;d do well to research a little more before you post. CA&#39;s not only have to validate your request for a certificate - which, in my experience, is strict to the point of nitpickery, at least among the major CA&#39;s - but they also have to host a server farm to process OCSP and CRL requests, process requests to revoke certificates, and have to adhere to a large bundle of rules and regulations. In the US I believe they use FIPS, in Europe it&#39;s Directive 99/93/EC which has been worked out into ETSI TS 101 456 and ETSI TS 102 042.  These specify requirements of constant internal audits and annual external audits bij ISO-certified independent bodies. Also, CA&#39;s must keep records for years in case of a legal dispute where the information is required as evidence. All this isn&#39;t free and go a good way to explaining the prices of certificates.

	&lt;p&gt;Comodo was also the company that previous had problems with resellers not checking domains at all - see Mozilla bug 470897.  They also allow certificates for domains that don&#39;t exist, such as Mozilla bug 526560, and certificates that name companies that don&#39;t exist, bug 599856.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mozilla, at least, refuses to enact any sort of punishment because they think users will blame Firefox when the SSL sites using those certificates stop working.  Essentially, they believe they cannot do anything that might possibly actually fix the problem of... well, the CA being crap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least these particular changes managed to land just in time for Firefox 4; it is the last commit on the relevant branch.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;That wasn’t the sort of security problem that should have been kept secret until patches were shipped — it was clear from the beginning that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bad guys were already able to exploit the bogus certificates,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;disclosing the existence of the bogus certificates would not have allowed more people to perform the attack they enabled, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;waiting to disclose the existence of the bogus certs only aided the ‘cyber-terrorists’ who had obtained them, by allowing the certs to be used for a longer period of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On their blog, I asked Mozilla why they agreed to keep this event secret: https://blog.mozilla.com/security/2011/03/22/firefox-blocking-fraudulent-certificates/#comment-109640&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I should ask you a few questions about &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; conduct in this matter as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You wrote above: “Mozilla expressed some concern about disclosure and I offered to embargo this document until Tuesday March 22nd, the launch day for Firefox 4.”  What concerns did they express, and why did those concerns convince you to aid in an attack by concealing the existence of these fraudulent certificates?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you inform anyone else affiliated with The Tor Project, Inc. before offering to ‘embargo this document’, or was that decision yours alone?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you believe that Mozilla would have included Comodo&#39;s root certificates as ‘trusted’ CAs in the final release of Firefox 4 if you had disclosed your discovery immediately, rather than delaying your disclosure?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;To reply your your questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) They expressed concerns about being able to ship a fix to Firefox - that is a brand new Firefox binary with hardcoded serials in their blocklist.&lt;br /&gt;
1a) We need Firefox to release before we can update the Tor Browser Bundle because our current build process on Windows does not include building Firefox from source. We probably need to change that but it is not my call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) I agreed to the embargo on my own - I informed people internally that I was looking for this when I started out and I informed Tor internally when I discovered it, I also again informed Tor when I agreed to the embargo.&lt;br /&gt;
2a) I let helix (the main Tor build engineer) know that Firefox would be releasing on Tuesday. Specifically, I explained why and what needs to happen for Tor users to be safe. See point 1a on why this is a PITA for Tor&#39;s hard working build engineer.&lt;br /&gt;
2b) I started advocating requiring (it&#39;s already enabled) OCSP checking from the moment that I realized it would provide a mitigation - I didn&#39;t embargo myself for mitigations, only some of the specific details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Mozilla will not give the Comodo CA in question an Internet Death Sentence. We do not know the extent of the compromise and Mozilla did not put off their launch for this extremely serious issue. I think that at the very least, this was a difficult choice for Mozilla. I believe that it was a mistake to not mark the direct signing cert of the certificates in question as untrusted. The rest of the root should have a closer inspection after release, of course. None of that was done for the same reason that OCSP checking isn&#39;t required - Mozilla makes these calls and decided they know best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I obviously disagree with these security choices because they rob the user of their autonomy; users need information to protect their activities on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&quot;Last week, a smoking gun came into sight: A Certification Authority appeared to be compromised in some capacity, and the attacker issued themselves valid HTTPS certificates for high-value web sites. With these certificates, the attacker could impersonate the identities of the victim web sites or other related systems, probably undetectably for the majority of users on the internet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did they attacker gain access to the additional information required for &#39;extended validation&#39;? An SSL Cert is only used to secure a site - not to say anything about the site owner. That is unless, they have been issued and EVC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All software is written by the new world order.  The Internet was developed by the US Dept of Defense to build a perfect tracking system.  Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Verisign, RSA, Symantec are all members of the same collusion set with the NSA, and other world governments.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disconnect now, or be subject to their whims and wrath.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve said too much for the black helicopters approach.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;There is already an implicit trust system built in that may be used in the meantime: DNS. This is what the RFC 4398 CERT resource record could help achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IANA is already a trusted 3rd party. IANA runs IP, AS, and DNS address allocation. If you want to connect to TORPROJECT.ORG, 86.59.30.36, or AS1 for that matter, look no further than an implicit trust chain emanating from ARIN. The question is, is ARIN more trustworthy than a random CA that Mozilla has mated with? I believe so, and I think many others believe so as well. Let the users decide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But alas, no implementation of RFC 4398, c. 2006, exists to date... We have all sorts of crazy iPhone apps, but no CERT RR implementation. The RFC likely needs expansive interpretation or outright modification for use in tandem with TLS and other widely used protocols. I hope some programmers that are well versed with browser plugins, libc/libresolv/windns/dnsapi/etc., and protocol considerations will get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just get something working, it has to be better than this. Otherwise, good article.&lt;/p&gt;

	DNS-Records without DNSSEC are no replacement for even the weakest CA infrastructure. *Every* possible exploitation scenario that involves a fraudulent certificate in an HTTPS connection -- i.e. every scenario which storing certificates in the DNS would supposedly fix -- give the attacker direct (if the user was lured to the wrong site by some sort of DNS manipulation) or indirect (if the attacker is on the same network as the user or on the path from user to original site) control over the DNS and therefore the CERT records.

	&lt;p&gt;DNSSEC is part of DNS as of RFC 4035, c. March 2005, which predates and is accounted for in RFC 4398 CERT resource records. In addition, use of IPSec could possibly bring confidentiality to recursive queries and authentication to stub queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, these concerns are largely moot.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;When Certstar got caught issuing a certificate for mozilla.com without doing valid checks (http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/12/23/0046258) people started calling out Comodo because Certstar was a Comodo reseller and Comodo shouldn’t have let that happen. That resulted in Comodo suspending that reseller’s ability to issue certifications because they were not fulfilling their proper contractual obligations to Comodo… During that process people were looking closely at Comodo trust paths, and Comodo was being nice and answering questions in forums to try and clear their name. During this questioning AddTrust came up. If you follow the thread around it reveals that AddTrust AB no longer exists as a company, but Comodo bought the certificates from them, and the rights to continue to use their root CA which bear the AddTrust name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history is illustrative, basically the AddTrust company was acquired by ScandTrust (out of Malmö, Sweden), which was a Swedish CA, and then Comodo purchased the AddTrust root from ScandTrust. Then Comodo also purchased UserTrust, which had four roots and those also became part of Comodo when UserTrust became a “Comodo Group Company”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both of the above cases the key material was removed from its original sites of operation (in Sweden and Salt Lake City, respectively) and trafserred into Comodo&#39;s data centres and backup centres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is interesting because defunct companies, that had been sold, transferred their key material around to different parties. I think that this is the wrong way to do this, and that the right way to do this is to revoke the certificates and the CA, but thats an expensive operation. So, I think what they do with these certs is that they actually recognize the lower value of such a CA, and what they do is is sell these certs at a cheaper cost, because they haven&#39;t been under the control of Comodo from the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They call these “Usertrust” CAs and they offer 3rd party vendors, such as Gandi to issue these certs, which are way cheaper than Comodo’s in-house generated ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;micah&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Can we at least start scoping SSL certs by internet domain to limit the damage?  Let a root CA sign for any domain, but create a COM CA that can only sign for *.com, and let it sell a google.com CA to google that can only sign for *.google.com and so on...&lt;br /&gt;
Or is this too detrimental to the business model to ever happen?&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Yes we could do with a better system based on gpg or something but they&#39;re struggling to get dns security right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Untill it is right and used by all then all a website owner can do in this regard is look after his key, data once received and mail systems. It&#39;s a joke the EV and CA costs for a &lt;strong&gt;false sense of security&lt;/strong&gt; which is making it take longer for a general consensus to want to find a new system. I&#39;m glad you can get the certs accepted by browsers for free. I&#39;d use self signed if browsers didn&#39;t say the worlds gonna end when you do. I think microsoft probably contemplated shutting your computer down the way IE reacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black helicopters were mentioned, the openbsd list had a discussion recently part of which was that the government can get CAs to cooperate and can MITM the network legally. Assuming they&#39;re systems don&#39;t have gaping holes, (quite probable running cisco and M$ rubbish at great expense) and they&#39;re employees are trustworthy (hmmm), then if you can still be MITM then you likely have far greater problems than SSL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CAs are dead&lt;br /&gt;
Long live, hmmm&lt;/p&gt;

	Shouldn&#39;t the browsers be able to spot this behavior fairly easily by taking &quot;signatures&quot; of the certs that they are presented with and comparing certs that are supposedly for the same host names? I know this is would be detecting the problem after the fact but it seems fairly reasonable, no?

	so we don&#39;t trust this douche-b (comodo) to release information about a huge security breach in a timely fashion but we /do/ trust him to name the &quot;state actor&quot; behind the attacks?? what a shocker that they named iran, the USSA&#39;s enemy du jour. i dont believe that bullshit for a second, now if u had said USSA&#39;s 51st satellite apartheid state, THEN i&#39;d believe you. who was behind STUXNET? who is more inclined to pull off this bullshit and blame it on others (by way of deception....) stop being so fucking stupid.

	I share your concern about Comodo&#39;s practices but at this point, I don&#39;t think they have much to gain by fudging or hiding info. Their reputation is seriously at stake and if they mess up, they will be history very soon.

	&lt;p&gt;Oh, that wacky Comodo / Usertrust / UTN CA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For debian and ubuntu users, here is a quick way to quit trusting this CA. I posted it back in 2008, when they issued a certificate they shouldn&#39;t have (see slashdot link above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo sed -ri &#39;/comodo|utn|addtrust/Is/^!*/!/&#39; /etc/ca-certificates.conf; sudo update-ca-certificates&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For firefox users on linux, run this with firefox closed:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;locate -er &#39;/cert8\.db$&#39; |sed &#39;s;[^/]*$;;&#39; |while read db; do echo $db; certutil -d &quot;$db&quot; -L |egrep -i &#39;comodo|utn|usertrust|addtrust&#39; |sed -re &#39;s; +[a-zA-Z]*,.*;;&#39; |while read cn; do echo &quot;- $cn&quot;; certutil -d &quot;$db&quot; -M -t cw,cw,cw -n &quot;$cn&quot;; certutil -d &quot;$db&quot; -D -n &quot;$cn&quot;; done; done&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For firefox users, using a gui:&lt;br /&gt;
http://benjamin.smedbergs.us/blog/2008-12-24/how-to-disable-the-comodo-r...&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Wonderful, wonderful. Unearthing this is clearly a sackload of work, for which kudos. Also notice how it is necessary and not something a random user would do. Since it IS necessary, it means safely using the thing is just about impossible except for experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, by the way, is a glaring error, omission, and oversight in security thinking. It keeps on cropping up any time crypto is introduced, and is closely related to the problems detailed in _Why Johnny Can&#39;t Encrypt_. Even Appelbaum thinks about this technically. The biggest concern is not that, it&#39;s that without deep technical understanding of the system it can be used neither safely nor securely. How&#39;s that for userfriendlyness? --bounce&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Went to upgrade FF, upgrade failed. Downloaded 4 and installed.  Immediately got OCSP errors going to Facebook. Turned on WS and started sniffing packets. Fatal error, bad certificates! Checked against list. Nope different numbers. Did about:config and made sure OCSP was turned on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It fails if it does not get a response. Good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checked  the IP where I was getting errors. Skype. Other errors, Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the Freedom To Tinker post, aha. Read this post, aha. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noticed that both CA use c=US in their name but do not support the listing of their X.509v3 certs in a  c=US X.500 directory when it is just simpler to hard code them into browsers and make the process opaque to users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The error becomes obvious, if one could easily lookup the right certificates one would not trust the rogue ones. Following the path in browsers has led me down strange alleyways smothered with snake oil, non-working addresses, and some developer who rolled up a demo and it ends up being on a financial site that I am supposed to be able to use to check a balance. Why, because no one is really paying attention, they just want to turn on the crypto, and who cares if it is valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But tell that to a browser. Any software with LDAP could fetch that certificate and make a comparison if the CAs supported the name space they have been exploiting. RFC4398...please give me a break. This is a systemic problem that is killing privacy for convenience. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&quot;Comodo also clearly demonstrate a mis-understanding - they believe that checks for revocation are proof positive that certificates are being used&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might be being dense - but isn&#39;t this statement backwards.  Shouldn&#39;t this be: they believe that NO checks for revocation are proof positive that the certificates are NOT being used.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Report of incident on 15-MAR-2011&lt;br /&gt;
An RA suffered an attack that resulted in a breach of one user account of that specific RA.&lt;br /&gt;
This RA account was then used fraudulently to issue 9 certificates (across 7 different domains).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://www.comodo.com/Comodo-Fraud-Incident-2011-03-23.html&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This only means that someone had got hold of a RA username and password. Comodo uses 2Tiers for their reselling. This has nothing to do with any CA certificate or breach of the PKI infrastrukture. The Certificate was revoked, as normal procedure in such circumstances. However, customes are protected by the Comodo insurance if they suffered any loss because of this, based on the type of certificate that was issued.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Jake, in your update you have harsh words for Comodo. This is surely justified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet your own company, Tor, is hardly a sterling example of protecting its users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Torbutton extension for Firefox is one of the most frequently downloaded extensions on that site, 4,687,639 downloads to date and 182,056 daily users on March 23rd. Torbutton bundles Tor, Polipo, and Vidalia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It advertises itself as &quot;currently the only addon that will safely manage your Tor browsing to prevent IP address leakage, cookie leakage, and general privacy attacks&quot;, thus giving the user a reasonable expectation of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet it was last updated April 19, 2010 -- nearly a year ago!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then there have been many bugfixes to Tor, including fixes to serious security-relevant issues. When will these bugfixes find their way into Torbutton?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By not updating Torbutton, you are putting millions of users of the extension at risk. Some of them may be dissidents in brutal dictatorships and the consequences to them of being found out are dire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from Firefox 4 compatibility and a couple addon conflicts, not much new in the way of security updates for Torbutton has been needed. If you want Firefox 4 support and fixes for some minor issues, use the alpha series at:&lt;br /&gt;

	The &#39;global trustee&#39; cert sounds to me like it could be a signing certificate rather than simply a normal normal site certificate. If so then the attacker could sign further certs of their own. Even worse is that OCSP is generally only applied to the leaf of trust, meaning that even if OCSP worked properly it wouldn&#39;t help should this be true.

	&lt;p&gt;Great post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.  I have a question here, you mention how browsers soft fail on a OCSP/CRL attempts. Now, assuming they are coded to hard fail. Even  then an adversary can MITM the OCSP request and defeat this  process right ? In this case, the browsers will be helpless sitting birds, unless the OCSP contact made by browser to CA has some measures in place to avoid a MITM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Opera seems to be maintaining a separate server of their own with certificates etc. Need to dig this deeper, but it seems to evade the whole CA down thing (assuming Opera will try to ensure that those servers are up)&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;What makes you guys think that solving for the CA&#39;s private key from the public key is all that hard.  Have you looked into how much (or how little) computation power is need these days to do this?  It certainly is within the capability of large corporations and even small countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole https security thing is bogus anyway unless the domain name server system can be secured.   Most companies are better off using their own (self created) certificates and changing them frequently (like weekly or daily).  The browser preapproved CA list just encourages forgery.&lt;/p&gt;

	There is no proof that finding the private key from the public key is a &#39;hard&#39; or &#39;large&#39; problem in the mathematical algorithmic sense - only that most people don&#39;t know how to do it efficiently.   In any event it is certainly no &#39;bigger&#39; than the factoring problem (factoring the product of two large primes) in which there has been alot of progress algoritmically.  Practically, in light of modern processors, say clusters of GPUs, backsolving private keys is almost personally affordable.

&lt;p&gt;OU = Hosted by GTI Group Corporation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d guess that makes the registration authority GlobalTrust Inc (a division of GTI Group Corporation).  They’re in Italy, which matches some news reports.  Their websites have also done a disappearing act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if this goes some way to explaining the strange &quot;global trustee&quot; certificate.  I apologise if this is already common knowledge, but I’ve not seen it mentioned anywhere yet.&lt;/p&gt;

	The extent of the problem is surely a matter of whether the signing key was obtained or not. If the attackers obtained that, then revoking the certs issued on the CA&#39;s computer are almost immaterial as the attacker can continue issuing certs on their own computer. Gah, this is such a mess.
