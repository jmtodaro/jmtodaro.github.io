<div id="content">
<p>You've flooded the blog and tor-assistants with lots of cries for help about Tor, Freegate, Ultrasurf, and a slew of VPNs all being blocked.  Sometimes this is through MTN Nigera, sometimes not.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.herdict.org/web/explore/country/NG" title="http://www.herdict.org/web/explore/country/NG" rel="nofollow">http://www.herdict.org/web/explore/country/NG</a> suggests access is a 50/50 chance for some sites.</p>

<p><a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#IinstalledTorandPolipobutitsnotworking" title="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#IinstalledTorandPolipobutitsnotworking" rel="nofollow">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#Iins...</a>.  That FAQ entry is a fine place to start.  Telling us Tor doesn't work lets us know there is a problem.  Sending in logs from Message Log would be a great start.  We need to know what Tor records while trying to connect to the Tor Network.  </p>

<p>Someone could further startup Wireshark and record the entire session of Tor starting up and ultimately failing to connect to the Tor Network. <span class="read-more"><a href="http://blog.torproject.org/blog/dear-nigerians-help-us-help-you"><strong>read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</strong></a></span></p>

<p>"<strong>«<em>we're unable to access the Tor Blog!!!!!</em>» a typical post at the Tor Blog, sent by Nigerian scammers!!!!</strong>"  lololol!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>lol!!! Yeah!!! that's the first thing i thought after reading this news!!!!!!!! hahahah!!!!!!  it's just a joke though!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Did you know that all honey bees are princes and princesses?!!!! it's because they all are children of a Queen Bee!!!!!!! yeah, it's true and so cute!!!!!</p>

<p>Well, just to write something that isn't too much offtopic, i want to ask a question!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I ain't sure about this, but if TOR, when starts, downloads a list of known nodes and their public keys!! well, isn't possible for an ISP to fake the list and inject a list of controlled nodes?!!!!!!!!!?!!!!!! or even, replace all the exit nodes with "bad exit nodes" while keeping the internal relays?!!!!</p>

<p>~bee!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

No. It isn't. Read the specification and specifically try to understand how directory authorities work.

Recently here in Chie Tor is blocked too, even the bridges will not work. We checked this out in Xi'an, Beijing and Shenzhen too, so it seems to be a whole China problem.

<div class="inlinecontent">
<p>Dear stupide people,</p>

<p>It is plainly obvious phobos and Tor know about the blocking problems in Nigeria.  The topic and content of phobos' block post is all about TOR IS BLOCKED IN NIGERIA.  They know it.  SHUT UP ABOUT IT.</p>

<p>I'm so sick of reading these comments.</p>

<p>Please remove your heads from your rear-ends and PROVIDE DATA.</p>

<p>1) In Vidalia, Choose Message Log.<br />
2) Change settings to INFO log level.<br />
3) Click OK.<br />
4) Restart Vidalia. And wait a few minutes.<br />
5) Open a ticket at trac.torproject.org, copy and paste the Message Log contents.  Use Select All.<br />
6) PATIENTLY WAIT for a response.<br />
7) now try again with bridges.</p>

<p>Without datum, all of us are blind.  Endlessly stating Tor is blocked in Nigeria does not help.  </p>

<p>Here is an analogue:</p>

<p>Kid: "I''m bleeding I'm bleeding! HELP ME!"<br />
Doctor on tele: "Where are you bleeding?"<br />
Kid: "I''m bleeding I'm bleeding! HELP ME!"<br />
Doctor on tele: "Please describe the wound and how much blood?"<br />
Kid: "I''m bleeding I'm bleeding! HELP ME!"<br />
Kid: "I''m bleeding I'm bleeding! HELP ME!"<br />
Kid: "I''m bleeding I'm bleeding! HELP ME!"<br />
Kid: "I''m bleeding I'm bleeding! HELP ME!"<br />
Doctor on tele:  Please go to a medical centre.  Or die. Cheers.<br />
Kid: "I''m bleeding I'm bleeding! HELP ME!"</p>

<p>Dear stupid Phobos,</p>

<p>We have known who the stupid person is now. How can u call all Nigerian stupid people.</p>

<p>Afterall, you have been supplied what you asked for, creating ticket at trac.torproject.org and still no solution.</p>

<p>Phobos, who is now stupid. You better respect our country, idiot. Fourteen days and counting since the creation of ticket 1645 and no solution. Genius my foot.</p>

it's a duplicate.  See 1645.  Someone should do some testing to figure out the *how* the internet is censored versus just that it is censored.

<p>Dear stupid Phobos,</p>

<p>We have known who the stupid person is now. How can u call all Nigerian stupid people.</p>

<p>Afterall, you have been supplied what you asked for, creating ticket at trac.torproject.org and still no solution.</p>

<p>Phobos, who is now stupid. You better respect our country, idiot. Fourteen days and counting since the creation of ticket 1645 and no solution. Genius my foot.</p>

<p>For the record, an anonymous commenter called people stupid.  I did not. My posts are clearly labeled as "phobos", such as this one.</p>

<p>As for ticket 1645, someone should upload more data or answer the questions asked.</p>

<p>It's clear tor is blocked in Nigeria, at least with MTN Nigeria and Etisalat ISPs.</p>

<p>No one has been able to tell me if using bridges works, or very recent public tor relays works, or given me any network traffic dumps showing how the ISP is blocking tor.  I suspect the block is simply a list of public tor relays' IP and tcp port combination, like every other country does it.   However, without someone doing testing from inside the country, I can't help solve the problem.</p>

<p>so in essence u are no more a genius mr Phobos<br />
what a pity<br />
i was thinking tor was unbeatable<br />
what a pity<br />
i guess we may have to check out for a better option atleast when ione door closes anoda one must open</p>

<p>but come to think of it which other information do u require,we connect throught bridges,proxy and ports and its no more going through now</p>

<div class="inlinecontent">
<p>I never claimed I was a genius.  Luckily, it doesn't take a genius to do some basic troubleshooting and problem solving. A few things get in the way of me doing my own proper debugging:</p>

<p>1) I'm not in Nigeria.</p>

<p>2) I'm not a customer of neither MTN nor Etisalat.  Customer service won't talk to me unless I can produce an account or phone number.  I'd like to find out if this blocking is mandated by the Nigerian Government or something each ISP decided to do on their own.</p>

<p>3) No one has provided contacts in Nigeria that are sufficiently technical to start reverse engineering the blocking.  Alternately, no one has provided a shell server in Nigeria for us to do our own research on the issue.</p>

<p>4) We need data.  Raw tor logs and/or traffic samples of controlled situations to see what is going on.  Controlled situations could be:<br />
a) raw tor (we have these)<br />
b) raw tor with tcpdump traffic samples<br />
c) tor using a published bridge from either https or smtp bridge pools<br />
d) tor using an unpublished bridge<br />
e) tor using a very new public relay as a bridge</p>

<p>5) Is the blocking just for MTN and Etisalat or are all ISPs doing the blocking?  As of late 2009, 6 ISPs were not blocking.  See <a href="http://opennet.net/research/profiles/nigeria" title="http://opennet.net/research/profiles/nigeria" rel="nofollow">http://opennet.net/research/profiles/nigeria</a></p>

<p>These 5 steps are just a start to figuring out what's going on in Nigeria.  </p>

<p>And for comparison, we've done these steps in other countries, like China, Qatar, Germany, Belgium, UK, Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, etc.  </p>

<p>The goal isn't to just fix the issue with a quick work around, the goal is to completely solve the problem and force the censors to take drastic measures or think very, very hard about the next step in the arms race.  Such drastic measures, like blocking all SSL connections or say, all of google.com, may have overwhelming financial and/or political costs the censors are not willing to incur.  Most of Turkey didn't care about censorship so much until they blocked all of google.  Now, your average business is unable to get its mail and respond with paying customers.  Now a far larger portion of your population cares about Internet censorship.  This is a similar situation to what occurred in Iran during the June protests in 2009.  Many businesses didn't so much care about the protests, but they really cared about the censorship forced on the country.</p>

If the people from Nigeria themselfs are not able to test these things, i'm sure you or some other people from Tor are able to find one or more proxy servers from within Nigeria to test these problems that obviously now have started to occur for the Nigerian Tor users .

<p>hello  Phobos<br />
tnx for ur reply.sorry my dear if we sounded so rude u know when one is so pressed or despirate he would try to do all he can to gain freedom,<br />
tnx for ur elaborate expanation its shows u are becoming concerned.</p>

<p>wel once again i would like to say that when i was using Tor here in nigeria it was simply splendid,easy connection,good downloadspeed,opens all website and so on ...</p>

<p>Quite unfortunate  that when i was trying to get used to lt,<br />
it was now blocked,<br />
wel conccering the questions u asked above i would try and give u the candid answers i have and i hope it helps also bear in mind that my skills in computer is average so i may not meet up with ur technical level and requirements,so u may please stoop a bit low to make urself clear awell  clearly explain the technical/engineering details u may require so that i can easily flow with u ok.</p>

<p>As regards to whether it is been blocked by the federal Government i dont think so.<br />
In Nigeria we have a poor consumer protection hence there is no protection of the consumer,the network provider does what they feel like doing without haveing the consumer in mind,what they are interested is to amass wealth from a fertile market here in nigeria without any major inpuback to the people to show appreciation</p>

<p>Lets take MTN for example that has the highest customer in Nigeria had been onground for about 2years before Globacom came in still sold a line @ about Ten thousand nigeria naira about 66.6 USD ,<br />
but wen Glo came up they sold their sim free but u must buy with airtime before MTN brouht out theirs<br />
also<br />
MTN billing was per minuite,hence if u make a second call or willing making a call and it cuts off u re charged for that minuite and when people complained they said before they could revert to per second billing it would be in about a years time,immiediately Glo was was lunched with free simpack and persecond billing MTN  quickly reveted to persecond billing by texting  a code to their call centre,what they said would be possible in about a years time,what do we enjoy as mtn customers,nothing,no free sms,call tariff not subsidized,no reduced of free internet service,just free call from 12:30midnite to 4:30am,pls tel me who would stay awake to make/receive calls at dat time.</p>

<p>wel whether they like it or not  FREE BROWSEING IS OUR RIGHT AND WE MUST ACHIEVE IT.</p>

<p>Secondly what do u mean by shell server<br />
raw tor with tcpdump traffic samples how do u generate that</p>

<p>wel as far as i know, i have known TOR to be working with MTN only it does not work other  GSM network providers (i stand to be corrected) such as Glo,Etisalat,Zain.<br />
probabily no one has tried to see it it works i tried with zain but it did not work.</p>

<p>Zain has aGPRS and EDGE<br />
Etisalate has EdGE<br />
GLo has GPRS<br />
MTN  3G,EDGE,HSDPA</p>

<p>1)below is my the tor data connecting using  MTN<br />
i use proxy to access the internet  10.199.212.2  Port 8080<br />
type                               HTTP/HTTPS</p>

<p>2) Allowed ports 8080,80</p>

<p>3) Bridges used i obtained from Get bridges@tor projects</p>

Free browsing is our right, we wil fight for it since our government are only concern wit politics, can't they see wat the finland government are doing to their citizen?? Every finland citizen has a legal right to  free high internet access.our service providers are taking dis opportunity to do wat do feel lik cos dere is no consumer protection. But we are tellin dem enough is enough. So  phobos we ar asking for a help to get us back on the track wit tor. tor is part of our lifes.  I deeply appreciate ur concern.  ayiddalal@gmail.com

phobes no bridges work here in Nigeria. How your freedom  solved it are very simple, they wrap all their connection in sslv3 and tunnel it, with means woith or without the default ip and port connections to their servers would be established in a couple of seconds... thats the means of my connection right now... pls creat a beta version that uses ssl and other more features.... we would be glad to let you know that even the bridges are not strong enough for our isp now... if you have any solution pls kindly help us.... thats 4m vince in lagos

but when freedom is going and i use<br />
127.0.0.1 p0rt 8080 on tor setting it rocks,but wen freedom goes off it no more connects<br />

<p>In general, a comment about this "censorship" in Nigeria.  I've heard from others that Nigeria is not censoring the Internet, but rather ISPs have closed the loophole that allowed users to get internet access without paying for it.  Their tests show that with a paid account, nothing is blocked, not even Tor.</p>

<p>Can you comment on that?</p>

yes we know this and even our isps know this also... thats why they allow certain level of browsing is allowed thats why with sslv3 one can connect to the internet with the MTN network... the bridges are no more useful. my opinion would be to change the pathern of our new version of tor to meet this thread.

No Sir though i have not tried it but i dont think it connects cos i once tried it with ETISALAT Nigeria which i do pay for and browse legally but TOR didnt connect. I think what the YOUR-FREEDOM people do is to change their server from time to time that is why when ever YOUR-FREEDOM is blocked by MTN Nigeria it connects after they change their server. Hope this information is helpful to you and by the way sir I MISS MY TOR

Phobos,that's not necessarily the truth.What is the truth is that,those loopholes that allows people to connect for free without paying have been block quite rightly and that's their rightful headache, but also,legitimate Tor users on monthly subscription to the ISP's have also been blocked,thereby blocking total access to the Tor network.In my own rightful opinion they do not have the right to block total access to the Tor network just to block their loophole.Let them freely block their loophole without necessarily stopping the legitimate users from using an anonymity software such as Tor.The right to anonymity is a universal right of all mankind and should be respected. From my own little research,most anonymity software are currently being targeted in Nigeria,for reason best known to them. As far as I know,several have been totally targeted and taken down under the guise of a certain loophole in the ISP system and it covertly portends a dangerous trends to us in the journalism profession and other fields of endeavors that requires strict anonymity for security reasons .

Yes Phobos, u r exactly right ... but before tor got blocked, we were able to access the internet without paying for it using tor. Tor still works but only with paid internet services, tor had a feature that allowed us to browse freely before it was blocked. All we want is that feature to be made available once again, I still wonder how your-freedom does it, wish it were possible to get in touch with your-freedom programmers so as to get this over and done with. We need your help, Phobos!

<p>in a country where the greater number of her masses are living below the poverty line,also in a country where we do no have a consumer protection board,well of course internet is not sensored in nigeria but the isp have indirectly sensored it by providing internet services at a very high rate,do u know how many subscribers MTN has<br />
yet they can not provide free internet service to the people they are milking from,<br />
lets do this little arithemethic,<br />
MTN has rolled out these lines<br />
0803xxxxxxx<br />
0806xxxxxxx<br />
0703xxxxxxx<br />
0706xxxxxxx<br />
0813xxxxxxx<br />
0816xxxxxxx,<br />
so i can u can have a better idea of how many subscribers they have</p>

<p>another simple comparism is the paid package for your freedom per month is about<br />
#753 or $5 while MTN charge #2500 or $16.67  between the hours of 10Pm t0 5am for a month.....imagine dat<br />
Freedom..........#753 or $5 per month<br />
MTN ...............#2500 or $16.67  (between 10pm to 5am for one month)<br />
MTN................#10,000 or $66.67 for one month</p>

<p>this is unfair<br />
it might interest u to knowmthat when Vmobile was in Nigeria they offered this service free of charge</p>

<p>so  if i can afford a paid subscription whats the essense for me to use Tor<br />
u had beta do something....i guess u find out how your freedom did theirs</p>

<p>l look forward to hearing a gudnews soon</p>

<p>cheers</p>

There is no software on Earth like “Tor”.  I have been searching for it but all to no avail. MTN I was told paid Millions of Dollars to block Tor. If only Tor programmers knows how much Nigerians value their programs, they would since have fixed the fools in MTN for good. Long live TOR. I will continue to hope for a breakthrough from TOR.

I use Tor to browse on my Starcomms paid account. It works! I used to use Tor den to browse free on my MTN before it was blocked. But I noticed it works on an MTN paid account. It is clear that MTN have blocked the loophole that allowed users browse free. I just recently learnt that YourFreedom now works on an unpaid MTN account. Anyways, the thing is that Tor tends to increase my internet bandwidth on my Starcomms because I noticed recently that Starcomms have decided to limit the bandwidth of users in order to make the network work faster. So far I think Tor is doing a good job here in Nigeria, thats for those who browse legally!....Thank you Phobos......John, in Nigeria.

<p>I see dats gud Mr John<br />
alias Oga Legal,<br />
so u even used Tor to browse free on your Mtn before it was blocked<br />
thats too bad of u and also a criminal act.<br />
i guess now u are now browseing legally wit ur so called starcom u shuold not combine it tor because tor uses variable ips from different locations and it is a criminal act to claim the ip of anoda country while you are in ngeria.<br />
Finally you have to make restitution to mtn for using their network illegally<br />
Holy John<br />

Like I said before, there is no program like Tor. Which one have I not tried? Right now, I am using Freedom. It is not as good as Tor. It works but some times it does not connect. Others are a waste of time. Tor does not work on MTN, paid account or no paid Account. They hate Tor and I think Tor should fix them for good. India web proxy is the only one that got close to the internet apart from the freedom I mentioned earlier, but they have no server. How Tor works, I really do not know. How I wish I was a computer programmer, I would since have devised a way of remodeling the program to beat MTN tricks. This company had been milking us dry in Nigeria. Please help us. Bob

It is a pity that MTN have decided to block Tor, for which they have every right to. It is also a pity that we Nigerians are not up-to-date with current events happening. If we must know, a fibre optic cable has just been installed and is 95% complete. The reason for this cable is to increase internet speed and reduce the cost of accessing the internet by at least 45%. Very soon we wont be paying as much as a $100 for internet access. So why are we still trying to look for ways to browse free. Nobody should blame MTN, we caused everything. Like i said earlier, Tor works perfectly well on my Starcomms and last time i checked it was working on a PAID MTN account. I dont think there is anything wrong with Tor. We should learn to do the right thing.....John in Nigeria.

for real... i think internet access is rather expensive in Nigeria that's why the average Nigerian is trying to kick back against this injustice. If it were in the U.S. by now the government would have done something about it. So i don't blame Nigerian..... I blame the government... and you fighting against such injustice towards Nigerians.... In my opinion, you deserve a Noble peace prize for even trying.... I mean you are aiding a whole nation... sorry I mean Nations... Not just Nigeria or Africa....

As for patience, I think we have all been patience. If not, all hell would have been let loose by now. They have also blocked Freedom just like they did Tor. The most painful thing is that they now block all most any thing that allows you to browse the web anonymously. They are exposing us to harm. Nigeria is among the counties no welcome by sites such as PayPal. People need to hide their IP to asses PayPal. MTN is almost making it impossible for me to do anything with PayPal. All attempts to browse anonymously so far had proved abortive. Someone is telling me to be patience. You think they will reduce their browsing prices because of those cables, think again. It will take another cheaper and reliable network to force the prices down. Wise up man. Bob
