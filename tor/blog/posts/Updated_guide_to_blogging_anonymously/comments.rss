	<description>&lt;p&gt;I think this guide still needs some improvments. I blog now for more than a year anonymously with Tor or jap on wordpress.com as suggested in this guide. With Tor there is a pretty annonying problem. You can&#39;t publish a newly written article. In 90% of the time you will get an error message telling:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oops! Sorry an error has occurred. Please contact us so that we can fix it.&lt;br /&gt;
Please remember that you have to provide the full, complete Blog URL, otherwise we can not fix it&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for submitting new articels I have to use jap becaue with Tor it fails most of the time reproducable.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>this happens frequently to me too, i set trackexithosts wordpress.com in tor and it went away.  wordpress doesn&#39;t like it when your IP changes, even when you&#39;re logged in and your cookie is valid.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;All kinds of talk coming out of Australia about the Aussie Govt&#39;s desire to control the web.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would a response as has been provided to the people of other countries be the right response to knock down &quot;The Great Wall of Australia&quot;?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second question.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that something that can be done right now to make their implementation useless from the get go or would it be better to wait until they are going great guns then drop Tor on their position?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wooly&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;If you have the chance to stop the Great Firewall of Australia from ever being built, now is a fine time to fight it.  Once these things are built, they are very hard to reverse and take down.  They seem to take on their own inertia and momentum and stick around &quot;just in case we need it&quot; or &quot;to keep the bad people out&quot;.  It makes for great sound bites for the press, even if it&#39;s trivial to bypass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From watching the news, I&#39;m not sure if there are organizations like the ACLU and EFF in Australia, but now is a fine time to find and support them.  Writing your representative, and get your friends to as well, is also a fine idea.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>ACTA and this new Australian Firewall are making the German data retention law look like a minor annoyance in comparison.

	<description>I was wondering if anyone&#39;s tried squeelr, the anonymous version of twitter and what you&#39;re thoughts were . . .   I&#39;m just experimenting with it now.

	<description>It&#39;s 2010. I&#39;m tired of reading articles from 3-5 years ago about &quot;how to blog anonymously using tor.&quot; Basically, tor is useless for anything other than browsing. Both blogger and wordpress suspended my accounts within hours after I signed up through TOR and began trying in vain to post.
