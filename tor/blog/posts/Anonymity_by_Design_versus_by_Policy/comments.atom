	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	I recently dropped a comment on a blog, and they responded mentioning that tor isn&#39;t all its cracked up to be.  The conversation had nothing to do with tor, they just saw I was using it based on their logs, I guess.  They mentioned that it has exit nodes leakage issues or some such.  I don&#39;t profess to understand all that, so what I&#39;m wondering is if that means they can see more specific information about me, or if its just showing tha I use tor.  Mind shedding some light?

	&lt;p&gt;We make it easy for sites to detect if you exit from Tor.  Unless you give more information, all someone will see is you are coming from Tor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s lots of misinformation out there about Tor.  People either don&#39;t understand it or purposely choose to not try.&lt;/p&gt;

	it is easy to detect that a web comment was made via tor, because the list of tor exit node ip addresses is public.  however, your system may still leak information to blog and comment websites due to various weaknesses in browser design and implementation.  torbutton (and some other software) is designed to address the latter sorts of issues.

	I suppose that makes it easy compared to detection of some other security measures, but it wouldn&#39;t seem to be effortless.  Unless I am missing something, there would still need to be a dynamic process to harvest the current exit nodes (I&#39;m assuming that exit nodes change over time, not just relays), and an automated or manual process to compare the IP address source for comments to that list.  I wouldn&#39;t think that most blog publishers would have an incentive to make that effort.

	&lt;p&gt;I agree with using Tor to protect your privacy. But as I have seen a rise of a new type of spammer. I disagree with abuse some names users have decided to use Tor for. As is I just started running a website to have a few users of Tor abuse my contact form to spam up my email box. So now I have all IP addresses banned server-side. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You I use Tor myself once in a while, but I my opinion it users like these that make Tor have a bad name. As is I&#39;m think of disallow the use of proxies on my site.&lt;br /&gt;
Other then that go Tor.&lt;/p&gt;

	No one that I know likes receiving spam.  But an important and elemental point of information privacy is that it be without exception.  As soon as you begin making it conditional (your definition of spam or mine? - your definition of freedom fighter vs terrorist or mine?) you have started your toboggan down a very steep and slippery slope inevitably leading to massive compromises of privacy from all kinds of motivations for all manner of beneficiaries (few of them good or even benign).

	I am also not too clear on how Tor facilitates this.  I could drop a comment on your web form using any number of anonymous email addresses (assuming that there is even a script that checks for valid addresses).  I can tell you from professional experience that ISPs that are eager to go after UCE abusers, even when furnished with a complaint and email headers, are in a very small minority.  Since a web form could be filled in by someone in a public library, at an internet hotspot, or from a computer at their workplace, I would think that ISPs would be even more reluctant to go after this kind of abuser.  In short, I see not reason why Tor would be necessary or even very useful for this (although it may have been used).

	&lt;p&gt;Tor lets you decide how much information to give to the site/person on the other end of your connection.  In your examples, sure someone could do that, but then the IP address is logged on the remote site, any ISP along the path could see the traffic and connection, and in most locations, there are observers who could place you at the computer (observers could be other patrons or cameras).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISPs go after all sorts of abusers, they don&#39;t care where the connection originates.  It depends upon your ISP.&lt;/p&gt;
