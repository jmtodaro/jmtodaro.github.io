<div id="content">
<p>Tor 0.2.0.35 fixes a big bug that was causing Tor relays with dynamic<br />
IP addresses to disappear from the network. It also fixes a rare crash<br />
bug on fast exit relays.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download" title="https://www.torproject.org/easy-download" rel="nofollow">https://www.torproject.org/easy-download</a></p>

<p>Changes in version 0.2.0.35 - 2009-06-24<br />
<strong>Security fix:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid crashing in the presence of certain malformed descriptors.<br />
      Found by lark, and by automated fuzzing.</li>
<li>Fix an edge case where a malicious exit relay could convince a<br />
      controller that the client's DNS question resolves to an internal IP<br />

</ul>

<p><strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>

<p><ul>
<li>Finally fix the bug where dynamic-IP relays disappear when their<br />
      IP address changes: directory mirrors were mistakenly telling<br />
      them their old address if they asked via begin_dir, so they<br />
      never got an accurate answer about their new address, so they <span class="read-more"><a href="http://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-02035stable-released"><strong>read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</strong></a></span></p></p>

Comment 1

</div>

<div class="inlinecontent">
<p>I currently have Tor 0.2.0.31 installed on OS X 10.4.11.</p>

<p>When I run the installer for the latest release (0.2.0.35) the installer says there is already a newer version installed. If I continue with the install anyway, it fails. There is no error message but the new version does not run.</p>

<p>After restoring the old version of Tor (0.2.0.31) from backup, everything is OK. Then I tried to uninstall the old version using the supplied script, but it fails, giving me:</p>

<p>root@sebago&gt; ./uninstall_tor_bundle.sh<br />
. tor process appears to already be stopped<br />
. Killing currently running privoxy process, pid is 196<br />
./uninstall_tor_bundle.sh: line 123: ./package_list.txt: No such file or directory<br />
. Removing created user _tor<br />
delete: Invalid Path<br />
. Cleaning up<br />
rm: fts_read: No such file or directory<br />
. Finished</p>

<p>Next, I restored again from backup and tried to manually uninstall following the documentation. However, some of the files and directories that are supposed to be deleted do not exist on my installation. Other files and directories that obviously belong to Tor are not listed in the documentation of what to delete.</p>

<p>After deleting everything I could find that looks like it belongs to Tor/Vadalia/Privoxy/Torbutton I ran the installer for version 0.2.0.35 again and it says the install was successful, but after restarting and trying to start Vidalia, it doesn't run.</p>

<p>Now I have 0.2.31 running again after restoring again from backup, but I am at a total loss as to how to properly uninstall or upgrade!!</p>

<p>Please help!!!</p>

<p>I keep getting this message: "Your server has not managed to confirm that its DirPort is reachable. Please check your firewalls, ports, address, etc"</p>

<p>I was hoping that, by getting the latest version of Vidalia/Tor, this would solve the problem; unfortunately, it hasn't. To be honest, everything else is working fine as far as connections/ports are concerned; however, with the Directory Port, I've tried every configuration with my wireless tp-link router, changing things on DNS, as well as going through different ports, but nothing seems to work. I'm at wit's end here, can anyone offer any help or guidance?</p>

<p>Yeah. That's a problem with 0.2.0.x. It's a cosmetic problem though -- nothing<br />
is actually going wrong, I think.</p>

<p>It's fixed in Tor 0.2.1.x.</p>

<p>In the postflight script in the Tor.pkg there is a line that fails:</p>

<p>su $USER /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin /Library/Torbutton/torbutton-$TORBUTTON_VERSION.xpi</p>

<p>It worked again when it was changed as in the corresponding package in 0.2.0.34 (use firefox instead of the firefox-bin executable):</p>

<p>su $USER /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox /Library/Torbutton/torbutton-$TORBUTTON_VERSION.xpi</p>

<p>The same results for firefox versions 3.0 and 3.5 for mac.</p>

<p>Hope this helps</p>

<p>pretty sad, today try to install tor on my OSX 10.5.7, with no succes.<br />
First 0.2.1.17-rc , Error in the Setup, but i try to run in anyway, using Firefox and Torbutton, error conectin to proxy. Use the documented uninstall procedure to test a downgrade to "Stable" 0.2.0.35. Same error on install and ( saying a newer version exist) so your script is LAME. pretty bad all i can say about my experience.</p>

<p>Actually, this is a bug in the Apple installer.  The necessary packages installed fine, and would require a reboot, but because the Firefox plugin for Tor failed to install, Apple aborts the entire installation and calls it all bad.</p>

<p>Dealing with the various issues with the Apple Installer is why we've been working on a drag and drop install routine for the Vidalia-Bundle for OSX.  We're also working on a Tor Browser Bundle for OSX to make using Tor even simpler.</p>

<p>Your install worked fine.  Reboot and everything should work as expected.</p>

<p>You may have to manually install Torbutton in firefox.  You can get it from the Mozilla Add-on site, or our site, <a href="https://torproject.org/torbutton" title="https://torproject.org/torbutton" rel="nofollow">https://torproject.org/torbutton</a>, or it's also located in /Library/Torbutton on your machine.</p>

<p>I had the install problem with Tor under OS X 10.5.7 as well.  Then I tried installing it again and it appeared to work.  But when I try using my Tor-enabled Firefox 3.5, it thinks I'm connecting to a bad proxy.  No Tor for me.</p>

<p>This is bad, is there some earlier version I can use?</p>
