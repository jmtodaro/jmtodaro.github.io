	<description>&lt;p&gt;are saying fu just wants attention by using a 12 year old attack he hoped no one at the conference would know about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and that tor is secure for some narrowly defined use case?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i am seeing that attacking tor no matter how trivial is a great way to generate press for yourself.  fu and marlinspike are winning the attention economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Marlinspike] ran SSLstrip on a server hosting a Tor anonymous browsing network. During a 24-hour period, he harvested 254 passwords from users visiting sites including Yahoo, Gmail, Ticketmaster, PayPal, and LinkedIn. The users were fooled even though SSLstrip wasn&#39;t using the proxy feature that tricks them into believing they were at a secure site. Sadly, the Tor users entered passwords even though the addresses in their address bars didn&#39;t display the crucial &quot;https.&quot; (Marlinspike said he later disposed of all personally identifiable information).&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>the internet is not secure, it never was.  marlinspike chose tor because he did not want to leave his parent&#39;s basement.  i could take sslstrip to any store that uses wifi and grab all of their data too.  starbucks, mcdonalds, etc are all fine places to do this attack too.  just because some pimply faced youth failed to think big doesn&#39;t mean tor is insecure.  tor is secure, perhaps not as anonymous as it once was, but from this panera store, tor is working fine.  damn kids and your hyperbole

&lt;p&gt;SSLstrip works on public Wi-Fi networks, onion-routing systems, and anywhere else a man-in-the-middle attack is practical. It converts pages that normally would be protected by the secure sockets layer protocol into their unencrypted versions. It does this while continuing to fool both the website and the user into believing the security measure is still in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation by a conference attendee who goes by the name Moxie Marlinspike is the latest demonstration of weaknesses in SSL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black Hat: Security Pro Shows How To Bypass SSL &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thoughtcrime.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Moxie Marlinspike&lt;/a&gt; captured 117 e-mail accounts, 16 credit card numbers, seven PayPal logins, and some 300 other miscellaneous secure login sessions in only 24 hours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marlinspike explained that he obtained such data by placing proxy software he&#39;d written, called &quot;sslstrip,&quot; on a node of a Tor network, to conduct what&#39;s known as a man-in-the-middle attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proxy software intercepts HTTPS traffic, generates and signs security certificates, and mediates data passing between the client and server, capturing everything in the process. And though there are ways to detect the attack, like recognizing that a Web URL begins with HTTP rather than HTTPS, none of the test victims noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attack can also be augmented with the addition of a lock icon, which would suggest to most users that the session is secure, even if it&#39;s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such tendencies allow Marlinspike to bypass SSL entirely. &quot;Lots of times the security of HTTPS comes down to the security of HTTP, and HTTP is not secure,&quot; he explains in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-dc-09/Marlinspike/BlackHat-DC-09-Marlinspike-Defeating-SSL.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;presentation slides&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marlinspike plans to release sslstrip later this week.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;With regard to vulnerabilities - they are everywhere. People have to be careful about what they are doing - or they can expect trouble.  The moral from this kind of stories is that we need some guidance on how to use Tor and what problems we can expect. Something like  &quot;Best Practises Guide&quot; ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&#39;d like to express my gratitude to the maintainers of the Tor project. Keep up the good work.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Given, Tor is a subset of the internet points, Tor is easy to statistically manipulate begin &amp;amp; endpoint attacks, and there is a known number of jumps, Could Tor be statistically manipulate in middle relay attacks by controlling a statistically significant number of relays to determine begin &amp;amp; endpoints? Statistically controlling enough Tor relays is the same as controlling all Tor relays, which is the same as controlling the begin and end points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many solutions are possible as one is trying to obscure a real identity for themselves. In the process of doing such, they have created one. Would it be better to get Tor into default settings on routers - OEM and third party (dd-wrt).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other Possible Solutions&lt;br /&gt;
 Package requests with fictitious requests. (Which is the real one?)&lt;br /&gt;
 Pass data back that was not requested with data that was. (Which is real one?)&lt;br /&gt;
 Combine two and cache requests for later retrieval of data. End user client will know which data is theirs, but multiple people will have requested such data on the network at similar times, making it appear more viral than individual. - Issue - others see random real and fictional requests on network and bandwidth increases.&lt;br /&gt;
 Integrate Tor into Router Firmware to increase number of Tor relays. (think this will help a bit in the numbers game. may allow for code injection and other vulnerabilities).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anonymous server applications, look at what can and can not be done. You can not break a code that does not exist and you can not hide what is in the open. Illusion, obscurity, overload, misdirection are all good ways of handling anonymity. Randomly combining them makes it easy for for only the initiator to know what truly was requested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tor, RAID/Torrents, encryption and cypher keys similar to Bible Codes etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>You should write up a paper and have it peer reviewed.  I think you&#39;ll find the current state of research in the areas you&#39;ve mentioned is further advanced and more complex than your simple overview.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;I guess many tor nodes are controlled, too many for privacy. You have to do something about it. Inject fake packets or cover traffic, otherwise its broken.&lt;br /&gt;
Never mind the net load, we need it in the future, believe me.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Your client doesn&#39;t trust the nodes already.  See, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.torproject.org/blog/circumvention-and-anonymity&quot; title=&quot;https://blog.torproject.org/blog/circumvention-and-anonymity&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://blog.torproject.org/blog/circumvention-and-anonymity&lt;/a&gt;, for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for cover traffic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#YouShouldPad&quot; title=&quot;https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#YouShouldPad&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#YouShouldPad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systems that introduce cover traffic are generally easy to separate the signal from the noise through statistical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;While reading about block-level encryption for hard drives, I came across the term &quot;replay attack&quot;, although I don&#39;t really understand it. I think it means that they repeat the same data more than once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember reading that Tor uses the CBC block cipher mode, all versions of which are vulnerable to that type of attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, the most secure block cipher modes I&#39;ve read about, CMC and EME, are not vulnerable to replay-block attacks but are vulnerable to replay-sector attacks. However, since that involved symmetric encryption on a hard disk, I am not sure how well it applies to network encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;I only use Tor to foil busybody ISPs or government agencies from snooping and logging my surfing habits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&#39;t dream of typing identification information (bank accounts, logins, credit card details or even my name) into any forms while using TOR, because of the possibility of compromised exit nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even using a paid VPN anonymizer, I wouldn&#39;t trust them enough to send such information through their servers.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>I&#39;m writing some copy for a paid proxy Server and I downloaded and used Tor every day for about a week. UNTIL....my Adwords a/c was hacked and they ran up €400 in clicks before Google and I noticed it - a new account set up with a daily spend of €2000. I suspect they probably got in through my gmail a/c which is obviously linked to the Adwords a/c.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, Tor is secure.  Google records the last few IP addresses which accessed your account.  It&#39;s a stretch to say, &quot;I had Tor installed&quot; and blame it for your Google account hack.  Did you always login via https?  Was your password guessed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of things could have happened and this could be a coincidence.  It&#39;s unfortunate that your first experience with Tor coincided with your Google problems.&lt;/p&gt;
