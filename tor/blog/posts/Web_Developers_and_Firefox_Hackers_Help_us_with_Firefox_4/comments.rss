	<description>&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what we are planning for the Firefox bugs. We also can pay for certain Tor tasks as well, but usually we want those done on a larger amount of work/timescale than per-bug basis, mostly because it is painful to assign a public dollar amount to *every* issue and task we want completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think we should assign explicit, public dollar amounts to the Firefox bugs? The problem I see with this is that the Mozilla code review process is an especially painful one. You can literally end up shepherding a patch for years (I&#39;m not kidding: see &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=280661&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bug 280661&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this means we probably should assign two sets of hourly rates, one before code review and one after, perhaps with two ceilings on these amounts. The rate before code review/submission would be higher, to encourage better work up front. Or perhaps this not right either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I think if we do not figure out a way to both allow people to bill before the patch is actually merged (perhaps once we merge it into Tor Browser Bundle, for example), and also to get compensated for dealing with Mozilla bureaucracy, we&#39;re going to end up with only partially written patches that never get finished, and/or we&#39;re not going to get any responses from people who have dealt with Mozilla before.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Oh, I just realized you want to be paid for exploits of Tor ;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hrmm, we&#39;ll need to think about this. Not all of Torbutton&#39;s Security Requirements are of equal worth/importance. #1 is proxy bypass, #2 is correlation of tor to non-tor. Then, much farther down, are things like fingerprinting and anonymity set reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find a bug against #1 (and maybe also #2, depending on the strength of correlation), we could possibly work something out &lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost/jmtodaro/tor/blog/posts/Web_Developers_and_Firefox_Hackers_Help_us_with_Firefox_4/../../smileys/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It would help if you would Update the outstanding Torbutton-related bugs page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;=============&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.1. Bugs impacting security&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Bug 280661 - RESOLVED FIXED &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Bug 418986 - Bounty by someone else&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;JonDonym 2010-09-10 11:40:46 PDT&lt;br /&gt;
We would pay 300 Euro for someone fixing this bug and putting it in the&lt;br /&gt;
official Mozilla code. And another 300 Euro for fixing it with CSS media&lt;br /&gt;
queries. Just contact me for further questions and discussions about the&lt;br /&gt;
implementation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;=============&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.2. Bugs blocking functionality&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Bug 445696 - RESOLVED DUPLICATE of bug 484832&lt;br /&gt;
2. Bug 290456 - RESOLVED FIXED &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;============&lt;br /&gt;

	<description>Ok, I&#39;ve updated the design doc bug list to take care of this. The list also needs another update to cover TLS issues, and new fingerprinting issues introduced in FF4.
