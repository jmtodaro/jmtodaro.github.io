	<description>Skype is one scary system! It&#39;s completely closed and proprietary, they claim they use encryption, but they offer no proof to that point, and they&#39;ve provided governments with the contents of conversations (they did this with the Chinese a few months back. They&#39;re pretty much everything Tor is fighting against! Seriously, it&#39;s terrifying to me that Tor developers use Skype - either you didn&#39;t know, which is scary, or you did know and didn&#39;t care - which is downright horrific.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Internet, public switched telephone network, public roads are all scary systems.  The toll collectors use proprietary technologies, do you fear them?  The people doing the interview used skype video, so chances are phobos did it for that reason.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is a public interview, where&#39;s the secrecy concern?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;take off the tin hat and google for &quot;security analysis of skype&quot;, read the papers in the results.  lots is known about skype and security issues.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>This a public conversation recorded for the public, thus no expectation of privacy on that call.  I would not assume that using Skype for an interview is equal to using Skype for personal and private conversation.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reverse engineering Skype isn&#39;t so hard.  If you assume someone is recording/watching you, you are ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the First Poster use AOL IM?  MSN IM?  ICQ?  GTalk?  Same thing, except the clients are open and OTR exists for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phobos gets points for fully removing his anonymity to the world.  Now I know who to look for at conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;I am an usual guy who don&#39;t know many about backtracking, anonymity services or hidden IP. But, I have a problem, and I hope, you, or somebody else, can help me.&lt;br /&gt;
My site has a login access with user/password and for every session everybody take a very long URL.&lt;br /&gt;
But, from my site the user can surf directly on other sites. If, on this sites, somebody has an traffic analyzer, it can seen on the log the entire URL. If he copy/past the URL in a regular browser he can go directly in the user account without any user/pass control.&lt;br /&gt;
Can you give me some advices to resolve this security problem?&lt;/p&gt;
