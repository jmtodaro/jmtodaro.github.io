	<description>Yes we received your email.  The person who builds the tbb&#39;s is trying to recreate your bug.  In the future, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.torproject.org&quot; title=&quot;https://bugs.torproject.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://bugs.torproject.org&lt;/a&gt; is a fine place to report bugs.

	<description>Hi phobos!!! Thank you very much for the link, i just took one account at the bugs house!!!, and very good for the email!!!!! but just to know, were all the newlines removed from my email?!!! I sent another message to myself, and even the banner of the webmail was appended at the end of my text, on the same line!!!!!!! I didn&#39;t even read what i wrote after writing it!!!!!, even if this is improbable, maybe that was a bit a difficult mail to read!!! but in this case it wasnt because of a my fault!!!!!!!! Well, ok!!!!!! bye!!!! ~bee!!!!

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It seems that GFW&#39;s techniques of blocking bidges have been updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Several days ago, if a group of bridges(3 bridges) have been detected by GFW, they would probably be blocked and the tor users in China cannot even establish a tor circuit. However, today it seems that if a group of bridges(3 bridges) have been detected by GFW, the tor users in China can apparently connect to to the Tor network via the group of bridges which seem to be fade bridges that are generated by the GFW, and surely the users can not view any web page via tor network.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>As far as our research finds, they are blocking by IP:Port combination, nothing more sophisticated.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tor relays/bridges are totally blocked by the China Great Firewall?!  I  tried several times in the past weeks, each time with a few new bridges, but never got through at all. Is it possible that the GFW is now smart enough to tell TOR traffic by some kind of protocol exchange signatures? Any way to fight this? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;
Waterson&lt;/p&gt;
